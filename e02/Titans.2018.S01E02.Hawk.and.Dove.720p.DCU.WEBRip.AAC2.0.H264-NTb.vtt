00:00:20.222 --> 00:00:21.723
<i>Previously on</i> Titans...

2
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.926
<i>The Flying Graysons!</i>

3
00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:29.298
The circus again!
The boy...

4
00:00:29.365 --> 00:00:31.335
It was just a dream.

5
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.043
<i>It's because you're scared
of me, what's inside of me.</i>

6
00:00:33.067 --> 00:00:34.703
Slut!

7
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.871
Mom.

8
00:00:35.938 --> 00:00:37.972
This woman is not your mother.
Tell her.

9
00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:39.084
I'm not your mother.

10
00:00:42.945 --> 00:00:47.017
Detective Grayson?
Amy Rohrbach, I'm your new partner.

11
00:00:47.082 --> 00:00:49.685
He's from Gotham.
Likes to work alone.

12
00:00:49.752 --> 00:00:51.920
<i>The mayor
has released a statement.</i>

13
00:00:51.987 --> 00:00:53.588
"This is a violent sociopath."

14
00:00:53.655 --> 00:00:55.957
It's you.
You're the boy from the circus.

15
00:00:56.024 --> 00:00:57.727
Can you help me?

16
00:00:57.794 --> 00:01:00.663
<i>There is something inside of me,
something evil.</i>

17
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.730
<i>My mom says there's
no such thing as monsters.</i>

18
00:01:06.034 --> 00:01:07.835
<i>I think she was wrong.</i>

19
00:01:07.903 --> 00:01:09.171
Where are we going?

20
00:01:09.237 --> 00:01:14.108
Somewhere safe.

21
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.855
What the fuck is this guy wearing?

22
00:01:27.923 --> 00:01:30.192
He's an eagle.

23
00:01:35.197 --> 00:01:36.965
Hawk, dipshit.

24
00:01:37.031 --> 00:01:40.570
Hawk?

25
00:01:40.635 --> 00:01:43.573
- Never heard of you.
- Wait.

26
00:01:43.638 --> 00:01:46.874
I need to ask him
some questions.

27
00:01:46.942 --> 00:01:49.192
Chain his legs.

28
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.959
Oh, yeah, set the mood.

29
00:02:06.528 --> 00:02:08.368
You guys in the boy scouts?
That's a nice knot.

30
00:02:10.132 --> 00:02:13.234
Gotta keep them kicks shiny,
you know what I mean, boys?

31
00:02:14.803 --> 00:02:18.906
Ow! Fuck.

32
00:02:21.176 --> 00:02:24.926
Gonna torture me or what?

33
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:37.826
What's your name?

34
00:02:37.893 --> 00:02:39.629
Fuck you!

35
00:02:39.695 --> 00:02:41.930
Who do you work for?

36
00:02:41.998 --> 00:02:46.998
All the people
your guns hurt, motherfucker!

37
00:02:47.502 --> 00:02:50.105
Son of a bitch.

38
00:02:51.307 --> 00:02:52.707
Take his pants down.

39
00:02:52.773 --> 00:02:53.773
Huh?

40
00:03:00.583 --> 00:03:02.518
Oh, hey, pal,
no, that's...

41
00:03:02.584 --> 00:03:05.353
We don't have to do that.

42
00:03:05.421 --> 00:03:06.421
Hey.

43
00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:35.483
My hero.

44
00:03:35.551 --> 00:03:36.819
You didn't wait for me.

45
00:03:36.886 --> 00:03:40.356
Yeah, you would've
said, "Not tonight."

46
00:03:40.422 --> 00:03:42.190
I should leave you
hanging like this.

47
00:03:42.257 --> 00:03:45.558
Whatever turns you on.

48
00:04:28.472 --> 00:04:33.472
Hmm. That part of the
anti-inflammatory diet, too?

49
00:04:38.045 --> 00:04:40.381
Call it a victory toast.

50
00:04:40.448 --> 00:04:42.718
Come on.
It's one beer.

51
00:04:42.785 --> 00:04:44.720
After what
we just pulled off...

52
00:04:44.787 --> 00:04:47.523
Relax. I want a swig,
that's all.

53
00:04:52.561 --> 00:04:56.131
Come on.

54
00:04:56.198 --> 00:04:59.669
Ah!

55
00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:03.571
Little sleep,
I'll be good to go.

56
00:05:03.638 --> 00:05:05.307
Maybe we skip it.

57
00:05:05.374 --> 00:05:06.876
Ah!

58
00:05:06.943 --> 00:05:08.511
That's just nerves talking.

59
00:05:08.576 --> 00:05:12.047
I don't get nerves, Hank.

60
00:05:12.114 --> 00:05:14.350
We have a solid plan.

61
00:05:14.417 --> 00:05:19.417
We shut this operation down for good,
we're talking walk away money.

62
00:05:19.821 --> 00:05:23.826
- And we will, right?
- As promised.

63
00:05:23.893 --> 00:05:27.763
We go to Wisconsin,
I get my new hip.

64
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.434
You can nurse me back to health.

65
00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:34.903
A girl wears
an outfit one time.

66
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.306
Come on,
let's get you out of here.

67
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.244
You can do it.

68
00:05:58.561 --> 00:06:00.230
What's this?

69
00:06:00.295 --> 00:06:02.665
You think I was gonna let
today go by without comment?

70
00:06:02.732 --> 00:06:07.569
Because today is...

71
00:06:07.636 --> 00:06:11.085
Three and a half years.

72
00:06:14.542 --> 00:06:16.511
I tied it myself.

73
00:06:16.578 --> 00:06:19.814
- You're very talented.
- Thank you.

74
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:24.081
You can open it
if you want.

75
00:06:27.489 --> 00:06:30.593
Happy anniversary.

76
00:06:30.658 --> 00:06:32.528
It was either this
or a toothpaste squeezer

77
00:06:32.595 --> 00:06:34.163
I found online.

78
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.333
So this is what
you were doing up here.

79
00:06:37.398 --> 00:06:39.001
I thought
you were drinking.

80
00:06:39.068 --> 00:06:44.018
I was building this
and drinking.

81
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.126
Hi.

82
00:07:04.193 --> 00:07:06.528
Oh, he's beautiful.

83
00:07:06.595 --> 00:07:08.631
You know, fun fact,

84
00:07:08.698 --> 00:07:12.201
they pair for life.

85
00:07:12.268 --> 00:07:14.537
Best three and a half
years of my life.

86
00:07:24.146 --> 00:07:25.946
God damn it.

87
00:07:39.595 --> 00:07:44.465
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

88
00:07:44.533 --> 00:07:45.867
Don't be sorry.

89
00:07:45.934 --> 00:07:49.085
It's just the stress.

90
00:09:21.564 --> 00:09:25.101
You're late, Boy Wonder.

91
00:09:25.168 --> 00:09:27.602
You know he always likes
to make a dramatic entrance.

92
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.070
True.

93
00:09:29.137 --> 00:09:31.607
I thought your boss
said to stay away from us.

94
00:09:33.041 --> 00:09:34.043
I didn't tell him.

95
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.045
Oh, so what is this,

96
00:09:36.112 --> 00:09:40.312
night out with
the bad kids?

97
00:09:41.617 --> 00:09:44.617
Something like that.

98
00:09:47.289 --> 00:09:48.524
You okay?

99
00:09:53.562 --> 00:09:55.798
Yeah.

100
00:09:55.865 --> 00:09:58.265
Just a headache.

101
00:10:32.568 --> 00:10:34.304
Thank you.

102
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.115
You want
a hot chocolate or something?

103
00:10:36.139 --> 00:10:37.741
Just coffee. Black.

104
00:10:37.808 --> 00:10:42.211
- I bet they have marshmallows.
- I'm not a kid, okay?

105
00:10:42.277 --> 00:10:47.078
- Okay. Same for the lady.
- Okay.

106
00:10:53.923 --> 00:10:58.923
My mom didn't like me
to drink coffee.

107
00:11:04.599 --> 00:11:07.150
Sweet tooth, huh?

108
00:11:12.875 --> 00:11:15.743
Rachel,

109
00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.347
has anything like...

110
00:11:18.414 --> 00:11:21.851
Like what happened,
ever happened before?

111
00:11:21.916 --> 00:11:24.617
No. Not like that.

112
00:11:27.823 --> 00:11:29.625
I didn't mean
to kill that guy.

113
00:11:29.692 --> 00:11:33.592
How did you kill that guy?

114
00:11:44.006 --> 00:11:47.243
We're gonna go see some old
friends of mine. They're safe.

115
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.679
They'll give us a place to lie low for
a second, get our heads together,

116
00:11:50.746 --> 00:11:54.083
figure out
what to do next.

117
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:57.019
You're scared, I get it.

118
00:11:57.086 --> 00:12:00.621
But sometimes
there's no time to be scared.

119
00:12:00.689 --> 00:12:01.991
Hey.

120
00:12:02.058 --> 00:12:07.029
No one's gonna get you.
Okay? I promise.

121
00:12:07.096 --> 00:12:11.445
Where else am I
going anyway?

122
00:12:24.079 --> 00:12:26.016
Total deracination.

123
00:12:26.083 --> 00:12:28.894
Essentially, all his organs burst at
once, leaving him a skin bag of blood,

124
00:12:28.918 --> 00:12:30.519
which I obviously drained.

125
00:12:30.586 --> 00:12:32.121
Obviously. COD?

126
00:12:32.188 --> 00:12:33.708
Sonics might have been
able to do this,

127
00:12:33.756 --> 00:12:37.291
but then his eyeballs
and testicles would've burst.

128
00:12:37.358 --> 00:12:38.694
No, this,

129
00:12:38.761 --> 00:12:40.795
this is fucking Biblical.

130
00:12:40.862 --> 00:12:42.397
Anything more specific?

131
00:12:42.464 --> 00:12:43.708
What part of fucking Biblical
did you not understand?

132
00:12:43.732 --> 00:12:46.102
- Charlie.
- Okay, uh...

133
00:12:46.168 --> 00:12:49.503
There's this.

134
00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.974
Looks like a raven.

135
00:12:53.041 --> 00:12:55.211
Forward everything to me,
would you, Charlie?

136
00:12:55.277 --> 00:12:57.947
Uh, and Rohrbach...

137
00:12:58.012 --> 00:12:59.948
Be careful.

138
00:13:00.015 --> 00:13:03.352
This one doesn't
feel right, you know?

139
00:13:03.419 --> 00:13:06.021
- Okay.
- I'm just messing with you. Jesus!

140
00:13:06.088 --> 00:13:08.222
You should see your...

141
00:13:39.121 --> 00:13:42.824
- <i>Hello.
- Hey, it's me.</i>

142
00:13:42.891 --> 00:13:44.293
<i>Master Grayson.</i>

143
00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.695
Look, I need some help.
It's a one time thing.

144
00:13:47.762 --> 00:13:49.399
<i>What is it, sir?</i>

145
00:13:49.464 --> 00:13:51.544
<i>- ...three Meryn Trants!
- Syrio didn't have a sword!</i>

146
00:13:55.003 --> 00:13:56.604
Hey, you want pizza?

147
00:13:56.671 --> 00:13:59.141
Okay.

148
00:13:59.208 --> 00:14:02.745
Anything on it?

149
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:06.147
Don't let anyone in.

150
00:14:06.214 --> 00:14:09.285
Is that <i>Game Of Thrones?</i>

151
00:14:09.352 --> 00:14:13.551
Should you
be watching that?

152
00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.461
Just don't get
pineapple on it.

153
00:14:19.527 --> 00:14:21.027
Obviously.

154
00:15:32.601 --> 00:15:34.136
Grayson.

155
00:15:34.203 --> 00:15:37.639
Try answering your phone once in a decade.
Where the hell are you?

156
00:15:37.705 --> 00:15:39.709
Working a case.

157
00:15:39.776 --> 00:15:41.886
<i>Remember that girl that threw the brick
at the cop car? She's in the wind.</i>

158
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.813
Yeah, a uniform
checked her out last night.

159
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.115
Then we find him dead
in some abandoned building.

160
00:15:46.181 --> 00:15:48.851
- The uniform, who was he?
<i>- Not ours.</i>

161
00:15:48.916 --> 00:15:50.886
ID, badge, all fake.

162
00:15:50.953 --> 00:15:55.953
- Could you forward me everything you got so far?
<i>- Yeah, doing it now.</i>

163
00:16:33.062 --> 00:16:34.663
No! No!

164
00:16:34.729 --> 00:16:35.897
Let me out!

165
00:16:39.301 --> 00:16:41.337
Our father who art in Heaven,

166
00:16:41.404 --> 00:16:46.404
Hallowed be thy name,
thy kingdom come...

167
00:16:53.582 --> 00:16:54.582
Rachel.

168
00:17:08.463 --> 00:17:11.267
Protect us from evil...

169
00:17:11.334 --> 00:17:12.969
Rachel? What happened?

170
00:17:13.036 --> 00:17:16.372
No! Don't touch me,
I don't want her getting out. No!

171
00:17:16.438 --> 00:17:18.442
Come here.
You're okay.

172
00:17:18.509 --> 00:17:23.509
You're okay. Nothing bad's gonna
happen to you. Don't worry.

173
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.591
- Doubles.
- That's your third double.

174
00:17:36.658 --> 00:17:39.595
- So?
- So you go directly to jail.

175
00:17:39.662 --> 00:17:42.164
Do not pass go,
do not collect $200.

176
00:17:42.231 --> 00:17:43.633
What? That's not a rule.

177
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.034
Actually, honey,
your sister's right.

178
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.305
Those are the rules, son.

179
00:17:49.372 --> 00:17:50.873
- Told you.
- Cheaters.

180
00:17:54.978 --> 00:17:59.147
Who could that be
this early on a Saturday?

181
00:18:00.515 --> 00:18:04.220
- Hold your fucking horses!
- Honey, language!

182
00:18:04.286 --> 00:18:06.086
Sorry, kids.

183
00:18:17.132 --> 00:18:21.604
You're activated.

184
00:18:21.671 --> 00:18:25.307
She's more dangerous
than she looks.

185
00:18:25.374 --> 00:18:28.374
Have a good morning.

186
00:18:38.319 --> 00:18:40.119
Family trip.

187
00:18:56.539 --> 00:18:57.772
Who's first?

188
00:18:57.838 --> 00:18:59.338
Me.

189
00:19:09.985 --> 00:19:12.354
According to those files,
the man who came after you

190
00:19:12.421 --> 00:19:15.325
may have been part of
some doomsday cult.

191
00:19:15.392 --> 00:19:19.561
They apparently believe it's their
destiny to prevent the end of the world.

192
00:19:19.628 --> 00:19:24.466
Does that mean
anything to you?

193
00:19:24.532 --> 00:19:27.403
Well, back when I was a kid,

194
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:31.339
you didn't get too angry,
or too scared.

195
00:19:31.406 --> 00:19:33.375
'Cause bad things happen.

196
00:19:33.442 --> 00:19:38.347
What kind of bad things?

197
00:19:38.414 --> 00:19:42.951
I guess I'm an orphan,
too, now.

198
00:19:47.857 --> 00:19:51.926
That billionaire,
Bruce Wayne,

199
00:19:51.993 --> 00:19:54.396
he raised you?

200
00:19:54.463 --> 00:19:57.098
Yeah.

201
00:19:57.165 --> 00:20:00.669
Must've been cool.

202
00:20:00.736 --> 00:20:03.587
It was complicated.

203
00:20:08.711 --> 00:20:11.414
Does it ever go away?

204
00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.647
What?

205
00:20:12.714 --> 00:20:15.751
The feeling
you got left behind.

206
00:20:15.817 --> 00:20:20.423
Yeah.

207
00:20:20.489 --> 00:20:23.938
Well, no, not entirely.

208
00:20:29.933 --> 00:20:34.703
You're gonna leave me,
too, aren't you?

209
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:39.308
No.

210
00:20:39.375 --> 00:20:44.346
No, I'm not gonna do that.

211
00:20:56.459 --> 00:20:59.494
So, who are these guys?

212
00:20:59.561 --> 00:21:00.930
Old friends.

213
00:21:00.997 --> 00:21:02.798
Truth is I haven't
seem them for a long time.

214
00:21:09.805 --> 00:21:12.808
Hey.

215
00:21:12.874 --> 00:21:14.510
Hi.

216
00:21:14.577 --> 00:21:17.044
Hi.

217
00:21:17.111 --> 00:21:19.347
I'm Rachel.

218
00:21:19.415 --> 00:21:20.415
Dawn.

219
00:21:28.123 --> 00:21:31.161
Can we talk?

220
00:21:31.226 --> 00:21:36.226
You're about four years
too late, but sure.

221
00:21:40.569 --> 00:21:45.519
Wow.
This place is huge.

222
00:21:48.309 --> 00:21:50.613
She killed someone?

223
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:55.519
She's just a kid.

224
00:21:55.585 --> 00:21:58.820
Whoever they are, they've got
people in the department.

225
00:21:58.887 --> 00:22:01.857
We needed somewhere safe
to regroup,

226
00:22:01.924 --> 00:22:04.193
think about
what I'm gonna do.

227
00:22:04.259 --> 00:22:07.864
What about Bruce?

228
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:11.379
He's no good with kids.

229
00:22:14.101 --> 00:22:16.571
Cop, huh?

230
00:22:16.638 --> 00:22:21.638
That's one
I never would've figured.

231
00:22:24.279 --> 00:22:25.580
How are you?

232
00:22:25.647 --> 00:22:27.616
We're great.

233
00:22:27.683 --> 00:22:29.117
Hank's feeling the life
a little.

234
00:22:29.184 --> 00:22:31.486
Age waits for no man
and all that.

235
00:22:31.553 --> 00:22:33.021
How bad?

236
00:22:33.088 --> 00:22:35.257
Two fractures, three
concussions in the last year,

237
00:22:35.324 --> 00:22:36.692
and a herniated disk.

238
00:22:36.759 --> 00:22:38.126
Jesus, Dawn.

239
00:22:38.194 --> 00:22:42.665
We're still good out there, Dick.
Really good.

240
00:22:42.732 --> 00:22:43.832
Not one slip-up.

241
00:22:43.899 --> 00:22:46.534
You should quit,
you both should.

242
00:22:46.601 --> 00:22:48.437
That's the plan.

243
00:22:48.504 --> 00:22:53.009
Soon as we take out these gun
suppliers he's obsessed with.

244
00:22:53.076 --> 00:22:58.076
One more chance to do some
good and he promised he's out.

245
00:22:59.447 --> 00:23:00.549
You could help us out.

246
00:23:00.616 --> 00:23:01.951
I'm out of the life, Dawn.

247
00:23:02.018 --> 00:23:07.018
Hey. The hell are you
doing here, Dick?

248
00:23:07.423 --> 00:23:08.490
Hank.

249
00:23:08.557 --> 00:23:09.858
I had a situation.

250
00:23:09.925 --> 00:23:11.728
Nice little reunion
you got going here.

251
00:23:11.794 --> 00:23:14.430
- You know it's not like that.
- Sure looks like it to me.

252
00:23:14.497 --> 00:23:16.297
Hank.

253
00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:23.806
What the fuck?

254
00:23:23.873 --> 00:23:28.873
Can we just
go back inside, please?

255
00:23:43.059 --> 00:23:46.796
I put Rachel in the spare
room and Dick on the couch.

256
00:23:46.863 --> 00:23:49.565
It's goddamn summer camp.

257
00:23:49.632 --> 00:23:52.100
What's he doing here anyway?

258
00:23:52.167 --> 00:23:55.738
Hell of a coincidence, him showing
up here night before a job.

259
00:23:55.805 --> 00:23:58.040
Coincidences happen.

260
00:23:58.107 --> 00:24:00.509
What, you think
I called him?

261
00:24:00.576 --> 00:24:04.747
Did you?

262
00:24:04.813 --> 00:24:06.715
I'm with you, Hank.

263
00:24:06.781 --> 00:24:09.586
Have been, will be.

264
00:24:09.653 --> 00:24:13.622
I'm gonna chalk it up to stress
that you don't know that.

265
00:24:16.091 --> 00:24:19.761
But now that he's here
we can use his help.

266
00:24:19.828 --> 00:24:22.498
We don't need him.
We've been fine.

267
00:24:22.565 --> 00:24:25.001
We have been.

268
00:24:25.068 --> 00:24:28.971
But fine might not be enough
to shut this gun op down.

269
00:24:29.038 --> 00:24:32.274
The three of us
are unstoppable.

270
00:24:32.341 --> 00:24:35.278
We could go out
on the win you want.

271
00:24:35.345 --> 00:24:39.181
And then you can heal,
get better.

272
00:24:39.248 --> 00:24:41.947
We can get better.

273
00:24:47.589 --> 00:24:50.725
He won't help us.

274
00:24:50.792 --> 00:24:54.896
He only watches out
for himself.

275
00:24:54.963 --> 00:24:58.864
People don't change, babe.

276
00:25:00.501 --> 00:25:02.637
We'll see.

277
00:25:02.704 --> 00:25:06.340
So, you and Dawn.

278
00:25:06.407 --> 00:25:07.842
No.

279
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:12.180
You realize it's impossible
to lie to me, right?

280
00:25:12.247 --> 00:25:16.786
When we were kids.

281
00:25:16.851 --> 00:25:18.419
Good night.

282
00:25:18.486 --> 00:25:21.636
Why did you hurt her?

283
00:25:24.393 --> 00:25:25.828
I didn't mean to.

284
00:25:25.895 --> 00:25:28.696
That's not an excuse.

285
00:25:28.763 --> 00:25:31.500
Yeah, well,
it's all in the past.

286
00:25:31.567 --> 00:25:33.367
Not for her.

287
00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.441
Get some rest.

288
00:26:08.235 --> 00:26:12.942
Hey, it's me.

289
00:26:13.009 --> 00:26:15.108
I'll be there.

290
00:26:38.467 --> 00:26:40.045
- Like the second to last one.
- Yeah.

291
00:26:40.069 --> 00:26:41.872
I've seen it.
You're gonna love it.

292
00:26:41.938 --> 00:26:44.115
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Why don't you go watch it right now?

293
00:26:44.139 --> 00:26:46.908
- And take your shoes off.
- Okay.

294
00:26:46.975 --> 00:26:50.780
Thanks, Khaleesi.

295
00:26:50.846 --> 00:26:52.982
What'd you do
with Rachel?

296
00:26:53.049 --> 00:26:54.917
You know, the sullen one?

297
00:26:54.984 --> 00:26:58.954
I didn't do anything with her.
I just didn't treat her like a kid.

298
00:26:59.021 --> 00:27:01.624
She's a good girl.

299
00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.859
Do you wanna take a look?

300
00:27:04.926 --> 00:27:07.430
At the case.

301
00:27:07.497 --> 00:27:09.831
<i>The supplier's name
is Bronson.</i>

302
00:27:09.898 --> 00:27:11.800
<i>He's moving
small hand guns.</i>

303
00:27:14.936 --> 00:27:16.873
He's trying to corner
the pre-teen market.

304
00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.707
Intel says they're making a new
shipment tomorrow night on the docks,

305
00:27:19.774 --> 00:27:21.510
and we think
we can break the chain.

306
00:27:32.887 --> 00:27:34.690
The famous Bird Computer.

307
00:27:34.757 --> 00:27:38.595
Wayne Enterprises tech?

308
00:27:38.662 --> 00:27:42.866
What happened between you two,
you and Bruce?

309
00:27:42.933 --> 00:27:46.233
Dragons?
This show just got so much better.

310
00:27:49.137 --> 00:27:50.905
It's a big responsibility.

311
00:27:50.972 --> 00:27:52.741
What?

312
00:27:52.808 --> 00:27:56.111
Taking her in.

313
00:27:56.178 --> 00:27:57.780
I mean, I know
how healing it must be,

314
00:27:57.847 --> 00:28:02.847
doing what Bruce did for you
when you lost your parents.

315
00:28:03.319 --> 00:28:05.187
But taking care of a kid
is complicated,

316
00:28:05.253 --> 00:28:07.790
you know that
better than anyone.

317
00:28:07.857 --> 00:28:12.294
I'm not taking her in.

318
00:28:12.361 --> 00:28:14.963
I'm not good at
the staying with people part.

319
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:19.300
I don't have to tell you that.

320
00:28:20.569 --> 00:28:22.905
Look, I know things
are tight around here,

321
00:28:22.972 --> 00:28:24.650
so I thought Alfred
could give me some money,

322
00:28:24.674 --> 00:28:27.909
maybe help out a bit,
help out Rachel at the same time.

323
00:28:27.976 --> 00:28:29.744
Two birds with one stone.

324
00:28:29.811 --> 00:28:31.247
Well, three, I guess.

325
00:28:31.313 --> 00:28:33.215
Wait, you want to
leave her here?

326
00:28:33.281 --> 00:28:34.716
Just for a while,
just until...

327
00:28:34.782 --> 00:28:37.853
Until when?

328
00:28:37.919 --> 00:28:40.088
You don't understand, Dawn.

329
00:28:40.155 --> 00:28:43.893
I'm no good at family.
I can't...

330
00:28:43.959 --> 00:28:45.860
You don't know
what I've become.

331
00:28:45.927 --> 00:28:49.932
What are you talking about?

332
00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:57.205
Dawn, do not hit
this delivery.

333
00:28:57.272 --> 00:28:58.783
Look at the number
of security contractors.

334
00:28:58.807 --> 00:29:00.376
Hey, don't change the subject.

335
00:29:00.443 --> 00:29:02.778
What do you mean
"what you've become"?

336
00:29:06.781 --> 00:29:10.217
Well, isn't this cozy?

337
00:29:10.284 --> 00:29:12.754
Hey.

338
00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:14.691
Just like the old days.

339
00:29:14.758 --> 00:29:16.524
We were just
talking things through, okay?

340
00:29:16.591 --> 00:29:18.394
Come and go,

341
00:29:18.461 --> 00:29:20.128
- take what you want.
- Hank.

342
00:29:20.195 --> 00:29:22.998
Don't touch me.

343
00:29:23.065 --> 00:29:25.000
- Stop.
- You want my girl now?

344
00:29:25.067 --> 00:29:27.069
Stop!

345
00:29:27.136 --> 00:29:29.386
Stop!

346
00:29:41.617 --> 00:29:43.117
I'm sorry.

347
00:29:48.022 --> 00:29:50.692
Jesus.

348
00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:24.191
What the fuck?

349
00:30:29.865 --> 00:30:33.935
Hey, you okay?

350
00:30:34.002 --> 00:30:38.107
What's your name?

351
00:30:38.174 --> 00:30:40.375
I don't have a name.
Where's your partner?

352
00:30:42.712 --> 00:30:44.847
- Tell us.
- Where is Dick Grayson?

353
00:30:44.914 --> 00:30:49.851
Where's Dick Grayson?

354
00:30:49.918 --> 00:30:51.552
Tell us where he is.

355
00:30:51.619 --> 00:30:52.820
Where is he?

356
00:31:06.702 --> 00:31:09.838
You sneaky kids.

357
00:31:09.905 --> 00:31:11.607
Didn't save any fun for us.

358
00:31:11.674 --> 00:31:16.624
We can still
have some fun, dear.

359
00:31:19.915 --> 00:31:22.550
Can't we?

360
00:31:36.398 --> 00:31:39.234
I'm sorry.

361
00:31:39.301 --> 00:31:41.771
It's getting worse.

362
00:31:41.838 --> 00:31:44.440
You don't have anything
to be sorry for, Rachel.

363
00:31:44.507 --> 00:31:49.507
I'm the one who should...

364
00:31:49.845 --> 00:31:53.817
How you doing, sweetheart?

365
00:31:53.883 --> 00:31:58.686
Hank is sorry.
He can be a real asshole sometimes.

366
00:31:58.753 --> 00:32:01.357
We gotta go.

367
00:32:01.424 --> 00:32:04.159
Hank and I have that thing.

368
00:32:04.225 --> 00:32:06.294
Dawn, I really think
you should reconsider.

369
00:32:06.361 --> 00:32:09.231
Okay? We both know
it's too dangerous.

370
00:32:09.298 --> 00:32:13.498
You win some,
you lose some.

371
00:32:14.903 --> 00:32:17.639
Take care of him, okay?

372
00:32:17.706 --> 00:32:21.475
He needs all the help
he can get.

373
00:32:21.542 --> 00:32:22.542
Okay.

374
00:32:36.058 --> 00:32:38.961
She needs your help.

375
00:32:39.028 --> 00:32:42.130
I can feel it.

376
00:32:42.197 --> 00:32:44.066
Isn't that what you do?

377
00:32:44.133 --> 00:32:45.967
What?

378
00:32:46.034 --> 00:32:48.870
You help people.

379
00:32:50.771 --> 00:32:53.622
I used to think so.

380
00:33:02.719 --> 00:33:07.719
I used to think it was one
of things I was best at.

381
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:09.625
Until I realized

382
00:33:09.692 --> 00:33:12.036
the more help some needed the
worse I had to hurt the others.

383
00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.761
Do you understand?

384
00:33:19.835 --> 00:33:22.638
Sometimes,

385
00:33:22.704 --> 00:33:27.704
when I feel
the darkness come out...

386
00:33:28.176 --> 00:33:30.726
...it feels good.

387
00:33:33.449 --> 00:33:36.819
I understand.

388
00:33:36.885 --> 00:33:39.454
You want to help them.

389
00:33:39.521 --> 00:33:43.725
You're just scared.

390
00:33:43.792 --> 00:33:48.792
Sometimes there's just
no time to be scared.

391
00:33:55.838 --> 00:33:57.106
Oh, shit!

392
00:34:04.914 --> 00:34:08.984
Dick was wrong.
Only a few of 'em.

393
00:34:09.051 --> 00:34:10.419
Oh, yeah.

394
00:34:10.486 --> 00:34:11.886
Wisconsin, here we come.

395
00:34:13.622 --> 00:34:14.622
Hank!

396
00:34:25.868 --> 00:34:26.868
Shit.

397
00:34:33.209 --> 00:34:35.609
Where were we?

398
00:34:35.676 --> 00:34:36.877
Oh, yes.

399
00:34:41.249 --> 00:34:46.249
I believe your pants
were coming down.

400
00:34:46.955 --> 00:34:49.492
This will be the worst

401
00:34:49.559 --> 00:34:54.095
and last pain
you ever experience.

402
00:35:02.238 --> 00:35:06.140
Go!

403
00:35:12.848 --> 00:35:14.647
No!

404
00:35:26.127 --> 00:35:29.577
Let's go the other way.

405
00:35:41.343 --> 00:35:45.914
You're welcome.

406
00:35:45.981 --> 00:35:46.981
Jesus.

407
00:35:51.153 --> 00:35:54.752
Come on.

408
00:37:04.928 --> 00:37:08.397
You weren't kidding
about having changed.

409
00:37:08.464 --> 00:37:13.464
I've never seen you
like that before.

410
00:37:19.341 --> 00:37:22.778
Rachel.

411
00:37:22.843 --> 00:37:23.894
Rachel.

412
00:37:37.526 --> 00:37:39.595
She's up here.

413
00:37:39.662 --> 00:37:43.098
Hey, what are you
doing up here?

414
00:37:43.164 --> 00:37:47.102
I was worried.

415
00:37:47.169 --> 00:37:51.106
Rach.

416
00:37:51.173 --> 00:37:53.122
What's wrong?

417
00:37:56.544 --> 00:38:01.049
You were gonna
leave me here.

418
00:38:01.117 --> 00:38:06.117
You said you weren't
but you lied.

419
00:38:07.055 --> 00:38:11.993
You must lie a lot.

420
00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:15.564
You're good at it.

421
00:38:15.631 --> 00:38:20.430
What's she talking about?

422
00:38:23.138 --> 00:38:24.473
Hank, don't read that. I...

423
00:38:24.539 --> 00:38:29.039
It's got my name on it.

424
00:38:33.247 --> 00:38:35.348
What the fuck?

425
00:38:42.124 --> 00:38:45.193
You were gonna
leave her here?

426
00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.696
You were gonna pay us?

427
00:38:47.763 --> 00:38:49.664
It's not that simple.

428
00:38:49.731 --> 00:38:52.834
"I know you guys
can watch out for her."

429
00:38:52.901 --> 00:38:55.336
Seems pretty simple to me.

430
00:38:55.403 --> 00:38:56.671
You were gonna buy us?

431
00:38:56.738 --> 00:39:00.309
Hank, slow down.
He's just trying to help.

432
00:39:00.376 --> 00:39:01.676
Wait, did you
know about this?

433
00:39:01.743 --> 00:39:03.278
- You saw what he did.
- That's enough.

434
00:39:03.345 --> 00:39:04.845
He's a fucking psychopath.

435
00:39:06.915 --> 00:39:11.915
Hey, Rachel,
I was gonna come back for you.

436
00:39:17.225 --> 00:39:20.796
Liar.

437
00:39:20.863 --> 00:39:25.133
You were never
coming back for me.

438
00:39:27.569 --> 00:39:32.569
Well, hello there,
you four.

439
00:39:35.678 --> 00:39:37.513
Who the fuck
are these guys?

440
00:39:39.013 --> 00:39:42.049
Rachel, come on.

441
00:39:45.453 --> 00:39:49.357
Get down.

442
00:39:49.424 --> 00:39:50.626
Wait, don't leave.

443
00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.490
Hank!

444
00:40:21.557 --> 00:40:26.194
No!

445
00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.260
Dawn!

446
00:40:41.877 --> 00:40:44.877
There you are, dear.

447
00:41:11.774 --> 00:41:13.140
Hank!

448
00:41:13.207 --> 00:41:15.008
Dawn.

449
00:41:21.082 --> 00:41:22.082
Dawn!

450
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:38.868
Dawn.

451
00:41:41.271 --> 00:41:44.807
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

452
00:41:44.874 --> 00:41:48.142
I'm dying.

453
00:41:48.209 --> 00:41:49.577
Dawn?

454
00:41:52.381 --> 00:41:54.316
Dawn!

455
00:41:59.421 --> 00:42:04.158
Dawn!

456
00:42:04.225 --> 00:42:05.225
Dawn!
