00:01:16.313 --> 00:01:17.835
Hello?

2
00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:24.452
Hello?

3
00:01:24.454 --> 00:01:26.543
Ladies and gentlemen!

4
00:01:26.546 --> 00:01:31.699
Boys and girls! The Flying Graysons!

5
00:02:55.346 --> 00:02:56.782
Rachel!

6
00:02:56.785 --> 00:02:59.115
The circus again! The boy...

7
00:02:59.118 --> 00:03:01.449
Take a breath, honey. Just calm down.

8
00:03:01.452 --> 00:03:03.353
He watched as his parents fell.

9
00:03:03.355 --> 00:03:07.482
Oh, God. It was... It
was so scary, I felt...

10
00:03:07.485 --> 00:03:09.291
It was just a dream.

11
00:03:09.293 --> 00:03:12.958
Okay. Just... Just breathe
like we practiced, okay?

12
00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:22.737
It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.

13
00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.308
Okay?

14
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.454
Sweetie, you need to get a
little more rest. Come on.

15
00:03:34.743 --> 00:03:37.243
Everything is gonna be okay.

16
00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.468
Mom?

17
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.004
Yeah.

18
00:03:55.006 --> 00:03:57.032
Keep the door locked.

20
00:04:38.332 --> 00:04:39.650
With the low pressure

21
00:04:39.652 --> 00:04:41.783
coming in, we will see
the temperatures dropping.

22
00:04:41.786 --> 00:04:46.487
Which means this rain would then
turn to sleet and possible, even snow.

23
00:05:36.074 --> 00:05:38.139
Detective Grayson. Amy Rohrbach.

24
00:05:38.141 --> 00:05:40.209
Transfer from Oakland.

25
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:42.411
I'm your new partner.

26
00:05:42.413 --> 00:05:45.892
Right. The Captain mentioned.

27
00:05:45.895 --> 00:05:47.028
It's a pleasure.

28
00:05:47.031 --> 00:05:48.130
I read your file.

29
00:05:48.133 --> 00:05:49.734
You seem to know what you're doing.

30
00:05:49.737 --> 00:05:54.572
You keep doing your thing, I'll
keep doing my thing. We'll be good.

31
00:05:54.575 --> 00:05:56.558
Don't take it personally.

32
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.293
I need a breath mint or something?

33
00:05:58.295 --> 00:06:01.630
He's been pushing off getting a
partner since he got here a month ago.

34
00:06:01.632 --> 00:06:03.798
Some shit about his
last one or something.

35
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.368
He's from Gotham. Likes to work alone.

36
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.876
Gotham?

37
00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:10.180
Jesus...

38
00:06:10.183 --> 00:06:11.774
What happened to his last partner?

39
00:06:11.776 --> 00:06:15.063
Gassed by The Joker. Who knows?

40
00:07:20.677 --> 00:07:23.485
Did you have breakfast?

41
00:07:23.488 --> 00:07:25.313
You shouldn't drink coffee.

42
00:07:25.315 --> 00:07:26.514
You shouldn't smoke.

43
00:07:26.516 --> 00:07:27.582
I quit.

44
00:07:27.584 --> 00:07:30.319
No, you didn't.

45
00:07:30.321 --> 00:07:34.389
Well, I'm going to.

46
00:07:34.391 --> 00:07:37.126
Darn it. I forgot to get cream.

47
00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:40.464
You forgot to get everything.

48
00:07:40.467 --> 00:07:42.162
Okay.

49
00:07:42.165 --> 00:07:44.048
I'm late.

50
00:07:44.051 --> 00:07:46.617
Can you take the bus
to school again today?

51
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.134
Sure.

52
00:07:48.137 --> 00:07:50.740
Okay.

53
00:07:50.742 --> 00:07:53.140
You never sleep anymore.

54
00:07:53.142 --> 00:07:55.610
No, not often.

55
00:07:55.612 --> 00:07:57.384
It's because you're scared of me.

56
00:08:00.517 --> 00:08:03.351
I am not scared of you, honey.

57
00:08:03.353 --> 00:08:06.454
I can tell when you're lying.

58
00:08:06.456 --> 00:08:09.618
I can feel it. You know I can.

59
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.317
Pray with me.

60
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.100
No, no. Talk with me.

61
00:08:19.103 --> 00:08:21.803
What's inside of me? What is it?

62
00:08:21.805 --> 00:08:24.274
Rachel, just please
pray with me. Please!

63
00:08:24.276 --> 00:08:26.209
- Our father who art in...
- No more praying.

64
00:08:26.211 --> 00:08:29.377
No more lying. Tell me
what you're not, Mom!

65
00:08:29.379 --> 00:08:33.180
Tell me!

66
00:08:33.182 --> 00:08:35.618
I'm sorry, Mama.

67
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.052
It's okay, baby!

68
00:08:37.054 --> 00:08:38.764
- Rachel!
- I'm gonna miss the bus.

69
00:08:38.767 --> 00:08:40.329
Rachel!

70
00:08:43.094 --> 00:08:45.161
Hey, kid. You tell your mother

71
00:08:45.163 --> 00:08:47.726
that screaming keeps us
up all hours of the night,

72
00:08:47.729 --> 00:08:49.165
I'm calling the police again.

73
00:08:49.167 --> 00:08:53.368
You hear me? I don't care
about your emotional issues!

74
00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:54.419
Weirdo.

75
00:09:03.246 --> 00:09:05.080
Boo!

76
00:09:05.082 --> 00:09:06.681
Come on. What are you hiding from?

77
00:09:06.683 --> 00:09:08.751
You don't have to be shy with me.

78
00:09:08.753 --> 00:09:09.989
I like freaks.

79
00:09:09.992 --> 00:09:12.854
Leave her alone, Kyle.

80
00:09:12.856 --> 00:09:15.491
Don't you have a touchdown
or something to throw, Matt?

81
00:09:15.493 --> 00:09:18.297
Just leave her alone, asshole.

82
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.862
Before I make you.

83
00:09:19.864 --> 00:09:21.329
Maybe you should take a seat.

84
00:09:25.602 --> 00:09:27.302
Knock him out!

85
00:09:27.304 --> 00:09:30.772
Sit back down! Both of you! Now!

86
00:09:30.774 --> 00:09:32.941
Come on. It was getting good.

87
00:09:36.047 --> 00:09:37.945
- Does it hurt?
- It doesn't hurt.

88
00:09:37.947 --> 00:09:39.480
Slut.

89
00:09:45.355 --> 00:09:47.008
Slut!

90
00:10:01.672 --> 00:10:06.174
Uh, Matt. Thanks for...

91
00:10:32.128 --> 00:10:33.414
Mom?

92
00:10:40.077 --> 00:10:43.344
Mom, I am really sorry
about this morning.

93
00:10:45.649 --> 00:10:50.685
Rachel. That's what she calls you.

94
00:10:50.687 --> 00:10:52.854
But that is not who you are.

95
00:10:52.856 --> 00:10:55.117
Let my mom go.

96
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.788
This woman is not your mother.

97
00:10:58.791 --> 00:11:00.462
Tell her.

98
00:11:00.464 --> 00:11:01.729
Tell her!

99
00:11:01.731 --> 00:11:04.366
I am not your mother.

100
00:11:04.368 --> 00:11:06.761
- But I do love you.
- No.

101
00:11:06.764 --> 00:11:09.203
You have good inside
your heart, sweetheart.

102
00:11:09.206 --> 00:11:10.372
Don't do...

103
00:11:11.442 --> 00:11:14.242
There. Now, that's better.

104
00:13:01.284 --> 00:13:02.684
Pink?

105
00:13:02.686 --> 00:13:05.887
The kids love it.

106
00:13:07.857 --> 00:13:09.195
What was that?

107
00:13:11.361 --> 00:13:13.336
I'm only here for Tyler Hackett.

108
00:13:24.442 --> 00:13:28.877
Leave the drugs. Leave
the guns. And walk away.

109
00:13:28.879 --> 00:13:30.313
Where's Batman?

110
00:13:30.315 --> 00:13:31.780
He could be anywhere, man.

111
00:13:31.782 --> 00:13:33.983
He's up there somewhere.
Look up. Look up.

112
00:13:33.985 --> 00:13:36.387
Oh, where's the Bat! Where is he?

113
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:40.055
Hey. The little birdie's alone.

114
00:13:43.626 --> 00:13:44.693
Get him!

115
00:14:30.031 --> 00:14:31.976
Tyler! Where you going, man?

116
00:14:47.424 --> 00:14:50.892
If you ever touch your
kid again, I will find you.

117
00:15:15.201 --> 00:15:17.001
Fuck Batman.

118
00:16:29.059 --> 00:16:30.993
Are you guys sure it's him?

119
00:16:30.995 --> 00:16:33.226
Absolutely, Captain.

120
00:16:33.229 --> 00:16:34.825
We called Gotham P.D.

121
00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:36.469
He hasn't been seen for over a year.

122
00:16:36.472 --> 00:16:37.695
Disappeared, they said.

123
00:16:37.698 --> 00:16:38.997
They thought he might be dead.

124
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.968
Why come here? Why Detroit?

125
00:16:40.971 --> 00:16:42.604
The weather?

126
00:16:42.606 --> 00:16:44.778
Let's just hope to hell
he's just passing through.

127
00:16:44.781 --> 00:16:47.343
You know the problems that
these masks bring with 'em.

128
00:16:47.345 --> 00:16:50.879
Painted freaks. Psychopaths in drag.

129
00:16:50.881 --> 00:16:52.719
We don't need that shit.

130
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.751
We got enough of our own
regular problems here.

131
00:16:55.753 --> 00:16:57.219
Come on, guys. Back to work.

132
00:16:57.221 --> 00:16:58.887
I need to talk to you
for a second, Eddie.

133
00:16:58.889 --> 00:17:00.989
Sure, Captain.

134
00:17:13.202 --> 00:17:16.537
Where to?

135
00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:19.207
Detroit. One way, please.

136
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.569
I'll give your compliments to the chef.

137
00:18:16.534 --> 00:18:20.469
My name is Sally. I work here.

138
00:18:20.471 --> 00:18:23.471
First, I don't need to know who you are,

139
00:18:23.473 --> 00:18:26.176
or how you got here, okay?

140
00:18:26.178 --> 00:18:30.513
What I really care about is keeping
girls your age off the streets.

141
00:18:30.515 --> 00:18:34.249
Or out of the adult shelters
which aren't much better.

142
00:18:34.251 --> 00:18:37.553
There's a youth shelter,
a few blocks from here.

143
00:18:37.555 --> 00:18:41.037
They'll have a bed for
you. No questions asked.

144
00:18:48.487 --> 00:18:49.836
Shortcut.

145
00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:01.477
I grew up here, me and this city.

146
00:19:01.479 --> 00:19:03.344
I've lived here since I was your age.

147
00:19:04.515 --> 00:19:07.849
On the streets, too.

148
00:19:07.851 --> 00:19:10.084
Shelters saved my life.

149
00:19:10.086 --> 00:19:11.453
Lies!

150
00:19:11.455 --> 00:19:14.234
She's lying. Look behind you.

151
00:19:17.528 --> 00:19:19.128
Hey, come on.

152
00:19:21.265 --> 00:19:24.866
I've been where you are.

153
00:19:24.868 --> 00:19:27.201
You feel like you can't trust anyone.

154
00:19:34.511 --> 00:19:36.444
What's wrong, sugar?

155
00:19:36.446 --> 00:19:38.742
I was just gonna give you a ride.

156
00:19:38.745 --> 00:19:40.758
Come on. It's okay.

157
00:19:50.345 --> 00:19:52.147
Run!

158
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:55.316
Rachel!

159
00:19:55.405 --> 00:19:57.140
Rachel!

160
00:19:57.143 --> 00:19:58.586
Wait!

161
00:20:00.397 --> 00:20:03.237
Wait!

162
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.075
Stop!

163
00:20:12.215 --> 00:20:13.922
Let's go, kid.

164
00:20:39.442 --> 00:20:44.112
Hey, uh, any luck on that Robin thing?

165
00:20:44.115 --> 00:20:46.481
Wait, are you talking to me?

166
00:20:46.483 --> 00:20:48.151
Is everybody else dead?

167
00:20:48.153 --> 00:20:52.250
Because I clearly must be the last
person on Earth for that to happen.

168
00:20:53.413 --> 00:20:55.123
I guess I haven't been
the most welcoming.

169
00:20:55.133 --> 00:20:59.476
Hey, Grayson. You got that
thing for helping kids, right?

170
00:21:02.365 --> 00:21:05.034
Hi, there. How you doing?

171
00:21:05.036 --> 00:21:07.182
Word on the street is
you like playing baseball

172
00:21:07.183 --> 00:21:09.240
with bricks and cop cars.

173
00:21:09.243 --> 00:21:11.641
I am Detective Dick Grayson.

174
00:21:11.643 --> 00:21:13.825
You wanna talk about what happened?

175
00:21:13.828 --> 00:21:16.344
It's you.

176
00:21:16.347 --> 00:21:20.536
- I'm not sure if you...
- You're the boy from the circus.

177
00:21:20.539 --> 00:21:22.499
Please.

178
00:21:22.502 --> 00:21:23.943
Can you help me?

179
00:23:28.174 --> 00:23:29.521

Hmm? Hmm?

224
00:29:35.013 --> 00:29:36.943

Who are you?

232
00:30:12.651 --> 00:30:16.785
Is this some kind of
sick practical joke?

233
00:30:16.787 --> 00:30:18.120
I remember.

234
00:30:18.122 --> 00:30:19.889
People were happy that night.

235
00:30:19.891 --> 00:30:21.088
What the hell is this?

236
00:30:21.091 --> 00:30:24.759
You, most of all.

237
00:30:24.761 --> 00:30:27.662
Your parents...

238
00:30:27.664 --> 00:30:29.231
I watched them fall.

239
00:30:29.233 --> 00:30:30.900
You kept wishing it was a dream.

240
00:30:30.902 --> 00:30:34.997
Wishing you would wake up.

241
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.367
Who put you up to this?

242
00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:38.469
Everything led me here.

243
00:30:38.472 --> 00:30:40.040
To you.

244
00:30:40.043 --> 00:30:42.511
It can't be by accident.

245
00:30:42.513 --> 00:30:44.514
You've got to help
me. I don't know how...

246
00:30:44.516 --> 00:30:46.047
You want help? So you
throw a brick at a cop car?

247
00:30:46.049 --> 00:30:47.350
You don't understand...

248
00:30:47.352 --> 00:30:50.372
- Okay, make me understand.
- Someone killed my mom!

249
00:30:58.962 --> 00:31:01.443
Okay. Name, address.

250
00:31:15.078 --> 00:31:17.713
She was all I had.

251
00:31:17.715 --> 00:31:21.365
The only person in the
world who cared for me.

252
00:31:23.653 --> 00:31:25.286
I am alone now.

253
00:31:36.366 --> 00:31:38.355
I want to help you.

254
00:31:47.115 --> 00:31:48.698
Listen, I'm gonna check this out, okay?

255
00:31:48.701 --> 00:31:50.101
Don't leave me here.

256
00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:53.799
Rachel, you vandalized a police car.

257
00:31:53.802 --> 00:31:56.599
- You're not going anywhere.
- You don't understand.

258
00:31:56.602 --> 00:31:59.302
You need to lock me up.

259
00:31:59.305 --> 00:32:01.339
Please.

260
00:32:01.342 --> 00:32:05.278
There is something inside of me.

261
00:32:05.281 --> 00:32:08.748
Something evil.

262
00:32:08.751 --> 00:32:11.967
I can't give you the
kind of help you need.

263
00:32:11.969 --> 00:32:14.670
I will find someone who can.

264
00:32:14.672 --> 00:32:16.482
Don't leave me here.

265
00:32:19.781 --> 00:32:21.716
Look, I'm sorry. I really am.

266
00:32:28.051 --> 00:32:31.216
Hey, so, she's saying
her mom was killed.

267
00:32:31.219 --> 00:32:33.523
If you could send someone
down there, that'll be great.

268
00:32:33.525 --> 00:32:36.525
Okay, I'll call you
if anything checks out.

269
00:32:36.527 --> 00:32:38.827
- Thanks.
- It's probably bullshit though.

270
00:32:38.829 --> 00:32:41.270
Kids down there livin'
on the street stealing...

271
00:32:41.273 --> 00:32:43.599
- The Mayor has...
- They'll say anything to get out of trouble.

272
00:32:43.601 --> 00:32:45.500
...released a warrant demanding the
crime fighting vigilante known as Robin...

273
00:32:45.502 --> 00:32:46.668
Yeah, I know.

274
00:32:46.671 --> 00:32:48.536
...to leave Detroit immediately.

275
00:32:48.539 --> 00:32:51.876
Quote. "This is a violent
sociopath." End quote.

276
00:33:11.931 --> 00:33:15.498
Hey, can I ask you something?

277
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.400
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

278
00:33:17.402 --> 00:33:20.803
So, what? You and your sidekick go bad?

279
00:33:20.805 --> 00:33:21.870
I'm sorry?

280
00:33:21.872 --> 00:33:23.907
Your partner at Gotham P.D.

281
00:33:23.909 --> 00:33:27.064
I mean, I'm no mind reader,
it just seems kinda obvious.

282
00:33:29.747 --> 00:33:32.814
I guess we had different
ideas of how to do the job.

283
00:33:32.817 --> 00:33:35.587
How's that? He on the take?

284
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:37.682
I heard most of Gotham is.

285
00:33:37.685 --> 00:33:39.954
No, not him.

286
00:33:39.957 --> 00:33:42.267
He was a hero to a lot of people.

287
00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.370
Including me.

288
00:33:44.373 --> 00:33:47.759
A stop-at-nothing guy who
solved everything with his fists.

289
00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:55.004
I admired him at first, what he did...

290
00:33:55.006 --> 00:33:57.001
Or was trying to do.

291
00:34:00.144 --> 00:34:03.211
But eventually, I had to walk away.

292
00:34:03.213 --> 00:34:04.564
Why?

293
00:34:09.085 --> 00:34:11.571
Because I was becoming
too much like him.

294
00:34:17.228 --> 00:34:19.862
So, you're not really, huh?

295
00:34:19.864 --> 00:34:20.929
What?

296
00:34:20.931 --> 00:34:22.030
An asshole.

297
00:34:24.235 --> 00:34:26.334
Don't tell. It will kill my rep.

298
00:34:26.336 --> 00:34:30.212
Yeah. Well, your secret's safe with me.

299
00:34:38.337 --> 00:34:40.483
Hey, there.

300
00:34:40.485 --> 00:34:41.814
We're gonna transfer you.

301
00:34:41.817 --> 00:34:43.568
We'll be putting you
in with the other kids.

302
00:34:43.571 --> 00:34:46.188
It will be safer for you there.

303
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:48.290
It's okay. Bring your bag.

304
00:34:58.899 --> 00:35:01.132
Right this way.

305
00:35:03.496 --> 00:35:04.568
Grayson.

306
00:35:04.571 --> 00:35:06.608
This is Officer Jones.
Traverse City P.D.

307
00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:09.811
- Mm-hmm.
- Girl you called in about, Rachel Roth?

308
00:35:09.813 --> 00:35:13.083
We found her mother. Gunshot to
the head. Looks like a homicide.

309
00:35:13.085 --> 00:35:15.884
I'll have our C.S.I send you
the details as we get them.

310
00:35:15.887 --> 00:35:17.485
Okay, thanks.

311
00:35:48.018 --> 00:35:49.952
Let me kill him!

312
00:35:49.954 --> 00:35:52.157
Let me kill him now!

313
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:23.978
Detective Grayson. Can I get
a 10-20 on the car number 310?

314
00:37:45.536 --> 00:37:49.604
My dear...

315
00:37:49.606 --> 00:37:52.240
I was worried for you.

316
00:37:52.242 --> 00:37:54.415
Who are you, exactly?

317
00:37:54.418 --> 00:37:56.120
Who am I?

318
00:37:56.123 --> 00:37:58.855
Who the hell are you?

319
00:37:58.858 --> 00:38:01.860
And who do you work for?

320
00:38:01.863 --> 00:38:05.728
Uh, I don't... I don't know. I...

321
00:38:14.146 --> 00:38:18.233
You come here, you sit at my side,

322
00:38:18.235 --> 00:38:20.642
you sleep in my bed!

323
00:38:20.645 --> 00:38:23.279
I trusted you!

324
00:38:23.282 --> 00:38:26.849
And you turn on me?

325
00:38:26.852 --> 00:38:30.087
You betray me?

326
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.758
Because of this girl?

327
00:38:32.761 --> 00:38:35.694
Who is she? What do you want with her?

328
00:38:35.697 --> 00:38:38.532
I don't know.

329
00:38:38.535 --> 00:38:42.223
I woke up in a car. And these
men were trying to kill me...

330
00:38:54.888 --> 00:38:56.687
I loved you.

331
00:39:01.101 --> 00:39:03.637
Oh...

332
00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.071
I don't think I loved you too.

333
00:39:08.828 --> 00:39:11.429
Yeah.

334
00:39:11.432 --> 00:39:14.934
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's a no.

335
00:39:14.937 --> 00:39:16.415
Wait!

336
00:40:11.991 --> 00:40:13.792
Rachel Roth.

337
00:41:05.903 --> 00:41:09.329
You've always known you
were different, haven't you?

338
00:41:15.211 --> 00:41:17.970
That you have a destiny.

339
00:41:17.973 --> 00:41:19.323
Please...

340
00:41:28.654 --> 00:41:31.587
I have been looking for you for so long.

341
00:41:34.156 --> 00:41:35.757
Let me go.

342
00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.498
Nothing resembles itself tonight.

343
00:41:38.501 --> 00:41:41.336
This dirty room is a church.

344
00:41:41.338 --> 00:41:46.374
I appear the villain but
in truth, I am the savior.

345
00:41:46.376 --> 00:41:48.110
You...

346
00:41:48.112 --> 00:41:52.882
You pose as the innocent,
but deep inside...

347
00:41:52.884 --> 00:41:56.228
You know you're fecund and damned.

348
00:41:56.231 --> 00:41:58.559
You have the skin of the lamb.

349
00:41:58.562 --> 00:42:02.025
The sheath by which he
will penetrate this world,

350
00:42:02.028 --> 00:42:03.659
and seed its destruction.

351
00:42:03.661 --> 00:42:06.443
But alas, you are the doorway

352
00:42:06.446 --> 00:42:10.331
he would walk through upright
to put out our sun, and I...

353
00:42:10.333 --> 00:42:15.269
Cannot allow that to happen.

354
00:42:15.271 --> 00:42:17.392
I have to save us all.

355
00:43:09.092 --> 00:43:14.092
I will lay your heart
beside the heart of a beast.

356
00:43:18.168 --> 00:43:21.025
And beside the heart of a simpleton.

357
00:43:29.646 --> 00:43:31.447
And burn them all.

358
00:43:32.983 --> 00:43:36.452
And the doorway will be closed forever.

359
00:43:36.454 --> 00:43:37.728
Don't hurt me!

360
00:43:43.103 --> 00:43:44.636
Rachel!

361
00:43:44.639 --> 00:43:47.027
Help! Help!

362
00:43:52.402 --> 00:43:54.017
Rachel!

363
00:44:37.379 --> 00:44:39.743
Rachel!

364
00:44:39.798 --> 00:44:41.117
Rachel!

365
00:44:41.119 --> 00:44:43.584
Rachel. Rachel, open the door!

366
00:44:43.586 --> 00:44:46.423
Rachel! Rachel!

367
00:44:47.962 --> 00:44:52.407
Rachel! Open the door!

368
00:45:29.596 --> 00:45:32.280
Rachel!

369
00:45:42.125 --> 00:45:43.280
What happened?

370
00:45:43.283 --> 00:45:44.616
I don't know!

371
00:45:50.419 --> 00:45:52.920
Please help me!

372
00:46:13.811 --> 00:46:16.010
This is yours?

373
00:46:16.012 --> 00:46:17.979
Family heirloom.

374
00:46:17.981 --> 00:46:20.749
From the circus?

375
00:46:20.751 --> 00:46:23.251
Not the one you're thinking.

376
00:46:23.253 --> 00:46:26.156
Come on, let's go.

377
00:46:34.989 --> 00:46:36.632
Where are we going?

378
00:46:39.111 --> 00:46:41.164
Somewhere safe.

379
00:46:44.908 --> 00:46:47.107
My mom

380
00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:49.796
says there's no such thing as monsters.

381
00:46:53.617 --> 00:46:55.562
I think she was wrong.

382
00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:18.233
Okay.

383
00:48:56.089 --> 00:48:57.507
Rad.

384
00:49:04.945 --> 00:49:10.953
