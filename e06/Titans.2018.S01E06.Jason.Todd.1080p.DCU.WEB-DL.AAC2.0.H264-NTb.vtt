00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:21.993
Previously on Titans...

2
00:00:22.027 --> 00:00:25.329
Bruce Wayne was at the circus
the night your parents died.

3
00:00:25.362 --> 00:00:27.431
I want to help you.

4
00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:29.667
He has volunteered
to be your foster parent.

5
00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:33.838
And, Dick, the police, they believe
it may not have been an accident.

6
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:35.106
Someone killed my parents?

7
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.951
I'm gonna find out who's
running this freak show.

8
00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:39.444
- I'll come with you.
- I thought we weren't splitting up.

9
00:00:39.476 --> 00:00:43.527
I'm coming back. I promise.

10
00:00:47.018 --> 00:00:50.420
Nap time, kids.

11
00:00:50.454 --> 00:00:51.823
Detective Grayson.

12
00:00:51.856 --> 00:00:53.967
Are you Mr. Adamson? And what
do you want with Rachel?

13
00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:58.991
You found me. So the Organization
is sending people to kill us.

14
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.066
If you don't give me
some answers...

15
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:18.049
Dick Grayson in the flesh.
Nice to meet you, bro.

16
00:01:18.081 --> 00:01:20.781
I'm the new Robin.

17
00:01:33.798 --> 00:01:37.802
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

18
00:01:37.835 --> 00:01:40.605
And He will welcome them
into the Kingdom of Heaven

19
00:01:40.638 --> 00:01:45.638
where they will dwell in the
house of the Lord forever.

20
00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.513
Let us pray.

21
00:01:48.546 --> 00:01:51.382
God, who did instruct
the hearts of the faithful

22
00:01:51.415 --> 00:01:53.685
by the light of the Holy Spirit,

23
00:01:53.718 --> 00:01:57.421
grant us in the same spirit
to be truly wise

24
00:01:57.454 --> 00:02:00.490
and ever to rejoice
in his consolation,

25
00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:03.727
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

26
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.760
Amen.

27
00:03:15.132 --> 00:03:17.467
They loved you.

28
00:03:17.502 --> 00:03:22.073
And they were proud of you.

29
00:03:22.105 --> 00:03:25.256
You know that, right?

30
00:03:31.282 --> 00:03:34.352
The police said
someone killed them.

31
00:03:34.384 --> 00:03:37.921
Someone burned the trapeze ropes

32
00:03:37.955 --> 00:03:41.192
with hydrofluoric acid...

33
00:03:43.894 --> 00:03:45.931
And disappeared.

34
00:03:45.963 --> 00:03:48.967
And the police can't find him.
Is that true?

35
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
- It's not your concern, Dick.
- Is it true?

36
00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:00.490
Someone will find who did it.

37
00:04:03.615 --> 00:04:05.082
I spoke with Ms. Bond.

38
00:04:05.116 --> 00:04:08.719
It sounds like Bruce Wayne is
serious about takin' you in.

39
00:04:08.752 --> 00:04:11.623
- But I wanna stay with you.
- I want that, too.

40
00:04:11.657 --> 00:04:16.656
But part of my agreement with your parents
was deciding what's best for you.

41
00:04:17.327 --> 00:04:19.430
Living with you
is what's best for me.

42
00:04:19.463 --> 00:04:23.199
Bruce Wayne
is a very wealthy man.

43
00:04:23.233 --> 00:04:26.471
And a very good man.

44
00:04:26.504 --> 00:04:31.504
He can give you everything
that I can't.

45
00:04:32.442 --> 00:04:34.843
I don't want to.

46
00:04:39.684 --> 00:04:42.653
Please don't make me.

47
00:04:46.858 --> 00:04:49.526
I know you don't believe me,
kiddo,

48
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.396
but trust me,
living with Bruce Wayne

49
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.430
is gonna change
your life forever.

50
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.528
Man, dude looks dead.

51
00:05:23.562 --> 00:05:28.562
Trust me. There's a difference
between dead and knocked out.

52
00:05:34.404 --> 00:05:36.439
This is awesome!

53
00:05:36.473 --> 00:05:38.975
Robin and Robin, in action.

54
00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:40.377
Who the hell are you?

55
00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:45.411
Jason Todd. The new Robin.
Robin 2.0, right?

56
00:05:49.487 --> 00:05:52.255
Hey, seriously, man,

57
00:05:52.288 --> 00:05:54.158
it's an honor to meet you.

58
00:06:02.798 --> 00:06:04.235
Yep.

59
00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:05.980
I always wondered what this
moment was gonna be like,

60
00:06:06.004 --> 00:06:09.240
never thought that when it
happened I'd be saving your life.

61
00:06:09.273 --> 00:06:11.074
So, there's a new Robin?

62
00:06:11.108 --> 00:06:13.142
Yours truly. In the flesh.

63
00:06:14.144 --> 00:06:16.613
- Does Batman know you're here?
- Of course.

64
00:06:16.646 --> 00:06:18.726
Bruce knows how badly I've
always wanted to meet you.

65
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.851
Pick your brain,
catch a couple of pointers,

66
00:06:20.884 --> 00:06:22.754
he's all, "Go for it, bro."

67
00:06:22.786 --> 00:06:25.154
Hey, let me go grab my clothes.
I'll be right back.

68
00:06:41.204 --> 00:06:42.341
Can't believe it.

69
00:06:42.374 --> 00:06:46.444
Here we are, together, in the same car.
This is so cool!

70
00:06:46.476 --> 00:06:48.478
Yeah.

71
00:06:48.512 --> 00:06:51.382
Real cool.

72
00:06:55.653 --> 00:06:57.689
So how long have you
and Bruce been...

73
00:06:57.721 --> 00:07:00.257
- Been...
- Together?

74
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.394
- Almost a year.
- A year?

75
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.166
Wow. Okay.
Didn't waste any time.

76
00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:12.237
- So how did you and he...
- I was out boosting cars.

77
00:07:12.269 --> 00:07:15.271
Guess I chose the wrong one.
Or the right one.

78
00:07:15.305 --> 00:07:16.708
You tried to steal
the Batmobile?

79
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.810
No, man. Just the hubcaps.

80
00:07:18.843 --> 00:07:20.610
And just like that,
he took you in?

81
00:07:20.644 --> 00:07:24.649
Guess he saw potential.

82
00:07:24.682 --> 00:07:26.817
So, what do you think
of the new suit?

83
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.095
Upgrades are pretty sick, right?

84
00:07:28.119 --> 00:07:30.420
The new tunic
is made with Zylon fibers,

85
00:07:30.454 --> 00:07:32.357
six times stronger than Kevlar.

86
00:07:32.391 --> 00:07:34.634
Seriously, bro, you can hit me
with a flame thrower from ten feet

87
00:07:34.658 --> 00:07:35.836
and I'd be like,
"That's all you got?"

88
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.728
- Zylon fibers.
- Smart, right?

89
00:07:37.762 --> 00:07:39.697
Hey, no offense
but you gotta admit,

90
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:44.730
the old version
was a little outdated.

91
00:07:48.505 --> 00:07:50.307
So how'd you find me anyway?

92
00:07:50.341 --> 00:07:51.375
The tracker.

93
00:07:51.408 --> 00:07:53.644
What tracker?

94
00:07:53.677 --> 00:07:55.846
In your arm.

95
00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:57.548
There's a fucking tracker
in my arm?

96
00:07:57.583 --> 00:08:02.151
Yeah. In mine, too. Don't you
remember him putting it in?

97
00:08:02.185 --> 00:08:05.021
No.

98
00:08:05.055 --> 00:08:07.605
Maybe you forgot.

99
00:08:11.362 --> 00:08:12.596
So, where are we goin'?

100
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:16.165
I gotta find a place
to put that guy.

101
00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:20.204
Can I make a suggestion?

102
00:08:20.237 --> 00:08:21.737
Sure.

103
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:30.110
According to Bruce, the design of this
place is inspired by Frank Lloyd.

104
00:08:30.615 --> 00:08:32.884
- Wright.
- I know, right?

105
00:08:32.917 --> 00:08:35.820
Dude's really into,
you know, lines and shit.

106
00:08:35.852 --> 00:08:37.489
Bruce has a bunch
of places like this.

107
00:08:37.522 --> 00:08:40.691
He calls them "safe houses,"
but they're more like condos.

108
00:08:40.725 --> 00:08:45.725
- Never been to one.
- You're lucky.

109
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.666
Access denied.

110
00:08:48.698 --> 00:08:50.349
I got this.

111
00:08:57.106 --> 00:08:58.775
Access granted.

112
00:08:58.809 --> 00:09:02.860
Guess he changed the locks.

113
00:09:23.433 --> 00:09:26.403
Why are you doing this?

114
00:09:26.437 --> 00:09:28.739
Why do you even
want to be Robin?

115
00:09:28.773 --> 00:09:31.942
Are you kidding?
This is the dopest gig ever.

116
00:09:31.975 --> 00:09:34.312
Hangin' out with Batman,
kicking bad guys' asses,

117
00:09:34.346 --> 00:09:39.017
being famous,
driving the goddamn Batmobile.

118
00:09:39.049 --> 00:09:43.850
He lets you drive the Batmobile?

119
00:09:45.722 --> 00:09:47.825
Wouldn't you rather
have your own name?

120
00:09:47.859 --> 00:09:51.028
Like "Sparrow" or "Blue Jay,"
for "Jason"?

121
00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:52.197
Fuck, no.

122
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.498
The whole point is being Robin.

123
00:09:54.532 --> 00:09:56.301
Batman needs Robin.

124
00:09:56.333 --> 00:09:58.802
Why do you think he makes us
wear those lame colors?

125
00:09:58.836 --> 00:10:00.071
'Cause we're drawing fire.

126
00:10:00.105 --> 00:10:03.173
"Look over here, assholes!"

127
00:10:03.207 --> 00:10:08.207
Then boom, the Bat lands
and starts trashing ass.

128
00:10:11.849 --> 00:10:16.849
Here, I'll go back
and get our friend.

129
00:10:31.635 --> 00:10:35.139
Who's this?

130
00:10:35.173 --> 00:10:37.575
- Niccolo Machiavelli.
- Yeah.

131
00:10:37.607 --> 00:10:39.543
Bruce has talked
about that dude.

132
00:10:39.576 --> 00:10:42.913
Sounds like a total savage.

133
00:10:42.947 --> 00:10:44.649
"If an injury
has to be done to a man,"

134
00:10:44.682 --> 00:10:49.287
it should be so severe that his
vengeance need not to be feared.

135
00:10:49.321 --> 00:10:51.990
Severities should be
dealt out all at once,

136
00:10:52.023 --> 00:10:54.392
so that their suddenness
may give less offense.

137
00:10:54.426 --> 00:10:57.595
Benefits ought to be
handed out drop-by-drop

138
00:10:57.628 --> 00:11:02.433
"so they may be
relished the more."

139
00:11:02.466 --> 00:11:05.135
You know, I used to
read about you as a kid.

140
00:11:05.169 --> 00:11:09.340
Bruce has told me tons of
awesome stories about you.

141
00:11:09.373 --> 00:11:10.875
I bet he has.

142
00:11:10.908 --> 00:11:12.186
I know it's none of my business,

143
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:16.860
but he never said why you quit.

144
00:11:18.982 --> 00:11:22.287
I guess I just couldn't cut it.

145
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.197
Are you thirsty? I'm gonna
go check out the brew sitch.

146
00:11:24.221 --> 00:11:27.827
- What?
- The beer situation.

147
00:12:27.251 --> 00:12:28.395
You've got impeccable timing.

148
00:12:28.419 --> 00:12:31.322
- Where the hell are you?
- Chicago.

149
00:12:31.355 --> 00:12:33.157
I thought you were
coming back here.

150
00:12:33.191 --> 00:12:35.960
Things got a little weird
at our friend's apartment.

151
00:12:35.993 --> 00:12:37.303
His name is Dr. Adamson,
by the way.

152
00:12:37.327 --> 00:12:39.397
Doctor of what, I have no idea.

153
00:12:39.431 --> 00:12:41.099
Let me guess.
He tried to kill you.

154
00:12:41.131 --> 00:12:43.033
He tried to cook me
breakfast, actually.

155
00:12:43.067 --> 00:12:44.635
His friends tried to kill me.

156
00:12:44.668 --> 00:12:46.947
Six of them. I got the feeling there's more
where they came from.

157
00:12:46.971 --> 00:12:49.306
You took out six assassins
by yourself?

158
00:12:49.339 --> 00:12:50.407
Not bad.

159
00:12:50.441 --> 00:12:53.243
Robin's got some skills.

160
00:12:59.783 --> 00:13:03.486
Any update on the family?

161
00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:07.292
Um, they're all dead.

162
00:13:07.325 --> 00:13:08.960
- Kory.
- I didn't kill them.

163
00:13:08.993 --> 00:13:11.861
I just walked in
and they were, like, dead.

164
00:13:11.895 --> 00:13:14.498
Their heads exploded.

165
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:15.633
Hell of a coincidence.

166
00:13:15.666 --> 00:13:19.903
- I...
- Fuck.

167
00:13:23.407 --> 00:13:26.744
Are you okay?

168
00:13:26.777 --> 00:13:29.080
Just dealing with something.

169
00:13:29.113 --> 00:13:30.648
Look, you guys
need to get out here.

170
00:13:30.681 --> 00:13:32.450
I'm at 888
North Lakeshore Drive.

171
00:13:32.484 --> 00:13:35.153
It's less than an hour.
You'll be safe here.

172
00:13:35.186 --> 00:13:37.654
- Are you sure?
- It's a safe house.

173
00:13:37.687 --> 00:13:42.488
It has "safe" right in the name.

174
00:13:44.294 --> 00:13:46.597
Hey, Jason, thanks
for the help back there.

175
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:50.067
But I'm good now. You
should head back to Gotham.

176
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.570
What the hell, man?

177
00:13:51.602 --> 00:13:56.073
I'm not Robin anymore.
Have a safe trip back.

178
00:13:56.106 --> 00:13:57.375
You didn't have to do that.

179
00:13:57.408 --> 00:13:59.811
- Yeah, I did. And you should, too.
- Why?

180
00:13:59.845 --> 00:14:02.246
Because we're not animals
in Bruce Wayne's private zoo.

181
00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:06.250
You don't get it, man.
He did it for you. For us.

182
00:14:06.283 --> 00:14:08.753
In case anything ever
happened, he could find us.

183
00:14:08.785 --> 00:14:10.488
Thanks for stopping by.

184
00:14:10.522 --> 00:14:12.956
Tell Bruce I'm gonna need the
place for a couple of days.

185
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.961
He should be okay with it.

186
00:14:16.994 --> 00:14:19.364
I'm not sure you really
understand him, man.

187
00:14:19.397 --> 00:14:23.701
I think I'm the one guy
in the world that does.

188
00:14:23.734 --> 00:14:25.269
Look, Jason,

189
00:14:25.302 --> 00:14:27.639
he might have you thinking
that you're a partnership,

190
00:14:27.672 --> 00:14:32.672
but everything Bruce does is in the
best interest of one person. Bruce.

191
00:14:34.077 --> 00:14:35.947
Time to go.

192
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:40.317
Sorry, man. I can't.

193
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:45.000
He wanted me to show you these.

194
00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:51.897
How did you get these?

195
00:14:51.929 --> 00:14:55.966
They were sent to the Gotham
PD addressed to "Robin."

196
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Whoever sent them
thinks you're still Robin.

197
00:15:01.705 --> 00:15:04.705
I know these people.

198
00:15:43.913 --> 00:15:45.182
Come here, kiddo.

199
00:15:54.424 --> 00:15:58.395
I worked with them
at the Haly's Circus.

200
00:15:58.428 --> 00:16:02.033
- Before your parents were...
- Yeah.

201
00:16:02.066 --> 00:16:04.168
That must've sucked.

202
00:16:04.201 --> 00:16:06.705
- He burns them with acid.
- Hydrofluoric acid.

203
00:16:06.738 --> 00:16:08.839
Calling card
of the Maroni crime family.

204
00:16:08.873 --> 00:16:11.842
- Harvey Dent, your parents...
- I know.

205
00:16:11.876 --> 00:16:15.446
Tony Zucco worked for the Maronis
when he killed my parents.

206
00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:19.750
But they were
put away years ago.

207
00:16:19.783 --> 00:16:21.951
Why'd he do it?

208
00:16:21.985 --> 00:16:24.020
Haly owed the Maronis
protection money.

209
00:16:24.054 --> 00:16:27.759
Couldn't come up with the cash.

210
00:16:27.792 --> 00:16:32.792
So my parents paid the debt
with their lives.

211
00:16:35.634 --> 00:16:37.402
Papers call this guy
"the Melting Man,"

212
00:16:37.434 --> 00:16:40.804
because he melts the flesh
right off their bones.

213
00:16:40.837 --> 00:16:43.837
Creepy as shit?

214
00:16:46.277 --> 00:16:47.544
Any idea who this freak is?

215
00:16:47.578 --> 00:16:49.613
The man I'm thinking of is dead.

216
00:16:49.647 --> 00:16:51.115
So that's a no.

217
00:16:56.153 --> 00:16:57.664
Have you checked back in
with the police?

218
00:16:57.688 --> 00:17:00.524
Why would I go
to the fucking cops?

219
00:17:00.557 --> 00:17:03.226
- Because five people were murdered.
- The cops are a joke, man.

220
00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:07.131
There's two kinds,
useless and dirty.

221
00:17:07.164 --> 00:17:10.602
- Is that what Bruce says?
- No, it's what I say.

222
00:17:10.634 --> 00:17:14.138
They hit a dead end so they came
crawling to Bruce and me. As usual.

223
00:17:14.173 --> 00:17:19.173
When Bruce realized who the victims
were, he sent me to find you.

224
00:17:34.858 --> 00:17:38.929
- You mind?
- Sure thing.

225
00:17:41.199 --> 00:17:42.199
Boom!

226
00:17:51.942 --> 00:17:54.479
Phone bill paid
last month, utilities on.

227
00:17:54.511 --> 00:17:59.250
Looks like he's still alive.

228
00:18:04.121 --> 00:18:05.522
This is Clay Williams.

229
00:18:05.557 --> 00:18:08.025
I'm not home right now,
so please leave a message.

230
00:18:10.327 --> 00:18:12.997
Milwaukee's only an hour
and a half from here.

231
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:14.531
I gotta go make sure he's safe.

232
00:18:14.566 --> 00:18:17.335
- We're going on a road trip. Excellent.
- Not us. Me.

233
00:18:17.367 --> 00:18:19.837
Look, I appreciate you bringing this to me.
I really do.

234
00:18:19.871 --> 00:18:23.441
But there's no reason for you to come.
This is personal.

235
00:18:23.473 --> 00:18:25.675
You're Bruce's Robin, not mine.

236
00:18:25.709 --> 00:18:26.978
No, I'm my Robin.

237
00:18:27.011 --> 00:18:30.681
- I don't need your help.
- You did back at that apartment.

238
00:18:50.835 --> 00:18:53.203
- Who are your friends?
- Not important.

239
00:18:53.237 --> 00:18:54.571
- Who's he?
- Not important.

240
00:18:54.605 --> 00:18:56.240
- Anybody want a brew?
- Yeah, I do.

241
00:18:56.273 --> 00:18:57.909
No, he doesn't.
No one wants a brew.

242
00:18:57.942 --> 00:19:01.010
- That can't be Adamson.
- He's not Adamson. Adamson's in the bathroom.

243
00:19:01.045 --> 00:19:02.646
- Unconscious.
- Hi, I'm Rachel.

244
00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.891
- Jason.
- Okay, who we all are doesn't matter right now.

245
00:19:04.915 --> 00:19:07.951
Can we just chill out, relax, sit on
the couch and watch TV or something?

246
00:19:07.984 --> 00:19:09.386
Yo, when did you
get another one?

247
00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:10.855
- That one's mine.
- Yours?

248
00:19:10.888 --> 00:19:13.656
- Wait, you're Robin, too?
- I thought you were Robin.

249
00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:15.393
- I am.
- He was.

250
00:19:15.425 --> 00:19:17.327
Okay, how many Robins are there?

251
00:19:17.361 --> 00:19:19.130
Are there a lot?
'Cause I would love to...

252
00:19:19.163 --> 00:19:20.696
Okay, quiet.

253
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:25.035
Sit.

254
00:19:25.068 --> 00:19:26.419
Bathroom.

255
00:19:31.942 --> 00:19:36.942
- Can I be Robin?
- My God.

256
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:42.920
- What happened to him?
- I gave him something to help him sleep.

257
00:19:42.952 --> 00:19:45.122
I kind of had my hands full.

258
00:19:45.155 --> 00:19:47.557
Well, did he say anything?

259
00:19:47.592 --> 00:19:50.094
He said he works for something
called "the Organization."

260
00:19:50.126 --> 00:19:52.529
And they work
for Rachel's father.

261
00:19:52.563 --> 00:19:55.232
He seemed to have
people everywhere.

262
00:19:55.266 --> 00:19:56.534
You sure you weren't followed?

263
00:19:56.567 --> 00:19:57.968
You sure you weren't?

264
00:19:58.001 --> 00:19:59.202
- Him?
- Yeah.

265
00:19:59.237 --> 00:20:02.306
He's not with the Organization.

266
00:20:02.339 --> 00:20:06.411
- He works for Batman, too?
- Yeah.

267
00:20:06.443 --> 00:20:08.979
He's my replacement.

268
00:20:09.012 --> 00:20:10.449
Good.

269
00:20:10.481 --> 00:20:13.651
Yeah, that's good. You said you
didn't wanna be Robin anymore, right?

270
00:20:13.684 --> 00:20:17.555
- Right.
- All right, so problem solved.

271
00:20:17.588 --> 00:20:22.192
Unless, of course,
you do wanna be Robin.

272
00:20:22.226 --> 00:20:26.030
In which case,
you should be Robin.

273
00:20:26.064 --> 00:20:30.902
Even though the new one's probably
younger, and healthier and smarter.

274
00:20:30.935 --> 00:20:33.605
I'm just trying to get used
to the idea of being replaced.

275
00:20:33.637 --> 00:20:38.637
Wow. An honest answer,
for once. Well done.

276
00:20:40.111 --> 00:20:43.346
What is he doing here, anyway?

277
00:20:43.381 --> 00:20:45.182
Some people I know were killed.

278
00:20:45.215 --> 00:20:47.585
The killer's still out there.

279
00:20:47.618 --> 00:20:49.697
There's someone I need to check
on, make sure he's okay.

280
00:20:49.721 --> 00:20:52.190
- So go.
- What about him?

281
00:20:52.223 --> 00:20:56.894
He is handcuffed and unconscious.
Pretty sure I can handle it.

282
00:20:56.928 --> 00:20:58.929
Unless you want me
to come with you.

283
00:20:58.962 --> 00:20:59.998
No. This is my problem.

284
00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:02.400
I'll be back. But I should
probably talk to Rachel.

285
00:21:02.432 --> 00:21:04.769
She's used to it by now.

286
00:21:04.803 --> 00:21:08.172
- What about the other Robin?
- He's comin' with me.

287
00:21:10.441 --> 00:21:12.477
And try not
to kill this one, okay?

288
00:21:12.509 --> 00:21:15.246
I didn't kill them.

289
00:21:19.084 --> 00:21:20.818
Then we got to the studio.

290
00:21:20.852 --> 00:21:23.386
So you heard something
in a bluegrass band,

291
00:21:23.421 --> 00:21:25.189
but didn't you wanna
work with them?

292
00:21:26.691 --> 00:21:29.192
And you basically created
a new genre.

293
00:21:29.226 --> 00:21:30.394
What do you call it again?

294
00:21:30.428 --> 00:21:32.596
Well, if you take
bluegrass and jazz

295
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:35.633
and put 'em together,
you get "bluegrazz."

296
00:21:35.666 --> 00:21:37.336
Ain't that somethin'?

297
00:21:37.368 --> 00:21:40.304
It was something so new and
fresh, it took me by surprise.

298
00:21:42.073 --> 00:21:45.242
Your ears peak, your mind opens up
to a whole new way of listening.

299
00:21:45.277 --> 00:21:50.277
Yes, that's the reaction
I was hoping for.

300
00:22:45.202 --> 00:22:49.039
The place is called Corvo.
It's some kind of speakeasy.

301
00:22:49.074 --> 00:22:51.608
Landlord said
he bounces the late shift.

302
00:22:51.642 --> 00:22:53.711
That's too bad.
Bouncers are assholes.

303
00:22:53.744 --> 00:22:56.682
Clay's not.
And how would you know anyway?

304
00:22:56.714 --> 00:22:59.884
Uncle Ray would take me to bars with
him all the time when I was little.

305
00:22:59.917 --> 00:23:02.420
Everyone thought it was cute,
till it wasn't.

306
00:23:02.452 --> 00:23:03.922
He was a fun drunk.

307
00:23:03.954 --> 00:23:05.698
Then he'd get stupid, then
he'd start throwing punches...

308
00:23:05.722 --> 00:23:07.490
Then the bouncers
would kick our asses out.

309
00:23:07.525 --> 00:23:08.759
Where were your folks?

310
00:23:08.792 --> 00:23:11.762
Mom was upstate.
Dad was downstate.

311
00:23:11.796 --> 00:23:14.230
Uncle Ray was the man
until he OD'd when I was 13.

312
00:23:14.265 --> 00:23:16.233
- Where'd you go?
- Wherever.

313
00:23:16.268 --> 00:23:20.538
Foster care. In and out of the system,
the streets mostly after that.

314
00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:24.041
It's not all bad. I survived.

315
00:23:24.075 --> 00:23:29.075
Now look, man,
we're living the dream.

316
00:23:37.821 --> 00:23:39.423
Clay Williams workin' tonight?

317
00:23:39.457 --> 00:23:42.307
- VIP lounge.
- Okay.

318
00:23:49.933 --> 00:23:51.568
There a problem?

319
00:23:51.602 --> 00:23:54.538
"Robert Plissken"? Nice try.

320
00:23:54.571 --> 00:23:56.708
Come on, man, be cool.

321
00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:58.576
Not tonight, snake.

322
00:23:58.608 --> 00:24:00.644
I'm 19.

323
00:24:00.678 --> 00:24:05.678
Okay, well, stay here.
I'll be right back.

324
00:24:40.183 --> 00:24:45.022
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

325
00:24:45.056 --> 00:24:48.759
So, how does someone
get into the VIP lounge?

326
00:24:48.792 --> 00:24:53.631
Give me the password.

327
00:24:53.664 --> 00:24:56.065
"Haly's Circus."

328
00:24:59.936 --> 00:25:02.606
Dicky?

329
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.044
Dicky! Lord,
I can't believe it's you!

330
00:25:06.076 --> 00:25:07.787
- Is this you?
- Yeah, it's me. I can't breathe.

331
00:25:07.811 --> 00:25:10.015
- Damn.
- Man.

332
00:25:10.048 --> 00:25:14.852
What in God's name
are you doin' here?

333
00:25:14.884 --> 00:25:16.684
Can we talk?

334
00:25:34.904 --> 00:25:38.076
Murdered?

335
00:25:38.108 --> 00:25:42.946
And I'm worried
you're next on the list.

336
00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.515
You've seen anything
weird at home?

337
00:25:44.548 --> 00:25:46.718
Any people following you?

338
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:49.086
Not that I've noticed.

339
00:25:49.119 --> 00:25:52.324
You still in touch with anyone from
the circus? Since it shut down?

340
00:25:52.356 --> 00:25:56.060
I spoke to Abigail a few years
ago after her husband died.

341
00:25:56.094 --> 00:25:59.663
I wanted to get in touch with
Percy but I could never find him.

342
00:25:59.696 --> 00:26:02.099
After the...

343
00:26:02.133 --> 00:26:07.037
We all went
our own separate ways.

344
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.605
Yeah.

345
00:26:08.638 --> 00:26:12.410
I think the last time
I saw any of them

346
00:26:12.442 --> 00:26:16.942
were at your parents' funeral.

347
00:26:18.583 --> 00:26:21.317
I should've kept in touch.

348
00:26:21.352 --> 00:26:22.619
Especially with you.

349
00:26:22.653 --> 00:26:27.592
Hey, it goes both ways.
I'm just glad you're okay.

350
00:26:53.117 --> 00:26:57.988
Okay, no excuses now.
We stay in touch.

351
00:26:59.324 --> 00:27:03.928
- Can't believe you're a cop.
- Detective, actually.

352
00:27:03.961 --> 00:27:08.499
All I know is I'm just
so proud of you, kiddo.

353
00:27:08.532 --> 00:27:11.001
You know,
I used to wonder all the time,

354
00:27:11.036 --> 00:27:14.337
what my life would be like
if I'd stayed with you?

355
00:27:14.372 --> 00:27:16.875
You know,
gone to a normal school,

356
00:27:16.907 --> 00:27:19.076
had some normal friends.

357
00:27:19.108 --> 00:27:21.244
"Normal"?

358
00:27:21.278 --> 00:27:23.614
You mean "poor."

359
00:27:23.647 --> 00:27:26.683
'Cause that's what
it would've been. Poor.

360
00:27:26.718 --> 00:27:31.718
But look at how
you turned out. Perfect.

361
00:27:32.288 --> 00:27:35.459
You look happy.

362
00:27:35.492 --> 00:27:38.730
Are you?

363
00:27:50.674 --> 00:27:52.710
Hey.

364
00:27:52.743 --> 00:27:54.979
My bad. Thought it was mine.

365
00:27:55.012 --> 00:27:56.280
Let me buy you another one.

366
00:27:56.314 --> 00:27:59.616
- It wasn't my drink.
- What the fuck are you doin'?

367
00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:02.520
I'm sorry, Mumford.
Did you say somethin'?

368
00:28:02.554 --> 00:28:06.257
- Do you want me to kick your ass?
- I want you to try.

369
00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.163
Shit.

370
00:28:13.196 --> 00:28:14.231
Let's do this.

371
00:28:14.266 --> 00:28:17.201
- Let's not.
- Back the fuck off. I got this.

372
00:28:17.233 --> 00:28:20.084
Jas...

373
00:28:22.773 --> 00:28:24.307
Clay, call 911.

374
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:27.678
My phone.

375
00:28:46.463 --> 00:28:49.599
Faker got lucky.

376
00:28:55.839 --> 00:28:57.741
Clay, you okay?

377
00:28:57.775 --> 00:29:00.377
No, he isn't.

378
00:29:00.412 --> 00:29:02.445
It's good to finally talk
to you, Dick Grayson.

379
00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.817
You arrived right on schedule.

380
00:29:05.849 --> 00:29:08.486
Who are you?

381
00:29:08.519 --> 00:29:11.321
You know.

382
00:29:11.355 --> 00:29:13.191
It's not possible.

383
00:29:13.223 --> 00:29:17.627
- Why not?
- Because you're dead.

384
00:29:17.662 --> 00:29:20.431
You must be thinking
of my father.

385
00:29:20.463 --> 00:29:24.468
Where's Clay?

386
00:29:24.501 --> 00:29:26.451
Who was that?

387
00:29:30.776 --> 00:29:33.943
This morning, federal authorities
arrested Anthony Zucco

388
00:29:33.944 --> 00:29:38.944
on charges of racketeering
and tax evasion.

389
00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:43.420
The arrest marks the end of a five-year
manhunt for the suspected murder

390
00:29:43.453 --> 00:29:44.690
and the man who police say

391
00:29:44.722 --> 00:29:48.326
ran the Gotham City branch
of the Maroni crime family.

392
00:29:48.359 --> 00:29:51.130
Zucco's lawyers issued a
statement today saying, quote,

393
00:29:51.163 --> 00:29:56.163
"This is a witch hunt. Our client, Mr.
Zucco, is innocent until proven guilty."

394
00:29:57.435 --> 00:29:59.371
If the court has already
made up its mind,

395
00:29:59.403 --> 00:30:04.403
"then the Gotham City justice is no
better than that of Batman himself."

396
00:30:11.348 --> 00:30:16.348
- Who's that?
- That's his son, Nick.

397
00:30:18.123 --> 00:30:20.424
I wanna talk to Zucco.

398
00:30:20.459 --> 00:30:22.370
I'm afraid we can't let you
do that, Mr. Grayson.

399
00:30:22.394 --> 00:30:24.630
We're stretching things
even letting you in here.

400
00:30:24.663 --> 00:30:27.065
But I want you to know that
we appreciate all the help

401
00:30:27.097 --> 00:30:29.500
from Wayne Enterprises
in tracking him down.

402
00:30:29.534 --> 00:30:33.904
Lot of people are gonna be taken
off the street because of this.

403
00:30:33.938 --> 00:30:35.307
You're cutting him a deal?

404
00:30:35.339 --> 00:30:38.375
Tony Zucco knows the players.
He knows the locations.

405
00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:40.278
And he knows
where the bodies are buried.

406
00:30:40.311 --> 00:30:43.347
He's the key to bringing down
the entire Maroni family.

407
00:30:43.381 --> 00:30:46.217
Instead of one guy, we're gonna
take down 50, maybe more.

408
00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:48.661
That man murdered my parents and
you're letting him walk free?

409
00:30:48.685 --> 00:30:51.021
We can't prove that,
Mr. Grayson.

410
00:30:51.055 --> 00:30:52.856
And he's not walking free.

411
00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:54.660
He'll be in protective custody.

412
00:30:54.692 --> 00:30:59.692
His whole family will have to be once the
Maronis find out he snitched on them.

413
00:31:01.098 --> 00:31:03.134
Things like this
happen all the time.

414
00:31:03.167 --> 00:31:05.303
I know it doesn't
seem fair, Mr. Grayson...

415
00:31:05.336 --> 00:31:07.872
This is why people
like Batman do what they do.

416
00:31:07.904 --> 00:31:09.650
You don't cut a deal
with a guy like Tony Zucco.

417
00:31:09.674 --> 00:31:11.686
You lock him in a jail cell
until he takes his last breath.

418
00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:16.710
Then you bury him under the
jail and burn it to the ground.

419
00:32:13.604 --> 00:32:17.054
What the fuck?

420
00:32:18.942 --> 00:32:21.011
Jesus!

421
00:32:21.045 --> 00:32:22.680
Watch out!

422
00:32:24.915 --> 00:32:26.250
What the hell's happening?

423
00:32:26.284 --> 00:32:30.554
Someone's on
the fucking roof. Come on.

424
00:32:32.123 --> 00:32:35.558
- Fuck!
- I don't see him!

425
00:32:35.593 --> 00:32:37.827
Keep looking.

426
00:32:51.575 --> 00:32:54.979
Shit.

427
00:33:08.659 --> 00:33:10.561
Please.

428
00:33:10.595 --> 00:33:13.864
How many people have you killed
that begged for their life?

429
00:33:13.897 --> 00:33:15.532
Look, I'll give you
whatever you want.

430
00:33:15.566 --> 00:33:19.336
I want my parents back!

431
00:33:19.369 --> 00:33:21.972
Grayson.

432
00:33:24.709 --> 00:33:26.810
Give me one reason not to.

433
00:33:26.844 --> 00:33:27.844
One!

434
00:34:01.011 --> 00:34:03.748
The Maronis.

435
00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:13.023
You gotta help me.

436
00:34:13.056 --> 00:34:16.594
Please.

437
00:34:16.626 --> 00:34:17.626
No.

438
00:34:49.994 --> 00:34:52.230
I killed his father.

439
00:34:52.262 --> 00:34:55.065
The guy who murdered
your parents?

440
00:34:55.099 --> 00:34:57.001
That's a win either way
you look at it.

441
00:34:57.034 --> 00:34:59.369
One less scumbag
on the face of the planet.

442
00:34:59.403 --> 00:35:01.871
Man, that must've felt awesome.

443
00:35:01.905 --> 00:35:03.206
Yeah, that's the problem.

444
00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:06.244
Hey, you want my advice?
Don't be Robin.

445
00:35:06.277 --> 00:35:07.746
All those years
Bruce was helping me?

446
00:35:07.778 --> 00:35:10.014
He was turning me
into a weapon, his weapon.

447
00:35:10.047 --> 00:35:13.050
And he may have you convinced that you
can get everything you ever wanted,

448
00:35:13.085 --> 00:35:16.487
but you can't unlearn what he teaches
you and you can't control it.

449
00:35:16.521 --> 00:35:19.023
Believe me,
the price is too high.

450
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:49.219
- I gotta go.
- Where?

451
00:35:49.253 --> 00:35:51.222
I gotta take care
of this by myself.

452
00:36:39.704 --> 00:36:44.704
That's close enough, Robin.

453
00:36:47.612 --> 00:36:52.612
I'm the one you're looking for.
Let Clay go.

454
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:56.487
Dick?

455
00:36:56.521 --> 00:36:57.789
You're gonna be okay, Clay.

456
00:36:57.822 --> 00:37:00.824
No, he isn't. He's going to die.

457
00:37:00.858 --> 00:37:03.360
So are you.

458
00:37:03.393 --> 00:37:06.431
You should thank me.
Death is better.

459
00:37:06.463 --> 00:37:08.465
- What happened to you?
- You did.

460
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.135
The feds told me what happened.

461
00:37:10.168 --> 00:37:14.972
Robin hijacked my father's transport
and offered him up to the Maronis.

462
00:37:15.007 --> 00:37:17.342
After your little meltdown
in the feds' office,

463
00:37:17.375 --> 00:37:20.244
it wasn't hard
to link you to Robin.

464
00:37:20.277 --> 00:37:22.213
I didn't know
the Maronis would be there.

465
00:37:22.246 --> 00:37:24.849
No, you wanted to do the honors.

466
00:37:24.882 --> 00:37:29.353
Either way, it seems I have you
to thank for what followed.

467
00:37:29.387 --> 00:37:33.391
Seems your little act
of revenge had consequences.

468
00:37:33.423 --> 00:37:37.228
After my father was killed,
the deal was off.

469
00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.231
No more federal protection.

470
00:37:40.264 --> 00:37:43.733
So, the Maronis
came after my mother...

471
00:37:43.766 --> 00:37:46.070
And my sister...

472
00:37:46.103 --> 00:37:49.273
And my fiancee.

473
00:37:49.306 --> 00:37:52.210
They all melted.

474
00:37:52.242 --> 00:37:54.846
They tried to melt me, too.

475
00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.782
So, you thought you'd even the
score by killing my family.

476
00:37:57.815 --> 00:38:02.815
That make you feel better?
Did your fucking plan work?

477
00:38:08.559 --> 00:38:12.309
Beyond my wildest dreams.

478
00:38:15.833 --> 00:38:19.336
When the acid strikes
your skin, it doesn't burn.

479
00:38:19.369 --> 00:38:21.639
It's much worse.

480
00:38:21.672 --> 00:38:26.344
It's like insects eating away
at your flesh...

481
00:38:26.376 --> 00:38:29.514
burrowing inside of you.

482
00:38:29.547 --> 00:38:34.547
I can still feel them
crawling all over me.

483
00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.930
I didn't want this
to happen to you, Nick.

484
00:38:37.954 --> 00:38:40.824
I'm not Nick anymore.

485
00:38:40.858 --> 00:38:45.730
That's what the acid
did for me. It changed me.

486
00:38:48.565 --> 00:38:50.802
You revealed
your true self on that bridge.

487
00:38:50.835 --> 00:38:55.072
Just like the acid peeled away the surface
to reveal my true self underneath.

488
00:38:55.106 --> 00:38:56.340
He's an innocent man.

489
00:38:56.373 --> 00:38:57.876
- Let him go.
- No!

490
00:38:57.909 --> 00:39:02.909
He gave you an out, dumb-ass.
You should've taken it.

491
00:39:49.559 --> 00:39:52.797
- Nice work.
- Dude deserved what he got.

492
00:39:52.831 --> 00:39:55.032
- Are you okay?
- Zylon fibers, man.

493
00:39:55.067 --> 00:39:56.811
You're welcome, by the
way, for saving your life.

494
00:39:56.835 --> 00:39:58.515
And you're welcome
for me saving your life.

495
00:40:00.704 --> 00:40:04.007
- We have to go.
- I'll take care of it.

496
00:40:06.876 --> 00:40:08.846
Clay, you okay?

497
00:40:14.251 --> 00:40:16.820
All right, fan out.

498
00:40:16.855 --> 00:40:18.289
Unit Five on the scene,

499
00:40:18.322 --> 00:40:20.626
responding to reports
of gunfire.

500
00:40:20.659 --> 00:40:25.659
Roger that, Unit Five.
Additional units are en route.

501
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.400
Got nothin'.

502
00:40:36.005 --> 00:40:39.009
Clear here.

503
00:40:51.556 --> 00:40:54.057
Get back! We need to jump back!

504
00:41:19.215 --> 00:41:21.418
Lights out, bitch!

505
00:41:22.987 --> 00:41:27.023
No!

506
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:34.032
What do you think
you're doing? They're cops.

507
00:41:34.065 --> 00:41:35.642
That's the coolest part
about being Robin.

508
00:41:35.666 --> 00:41:38.469
Wearin' a mask. I can do
whatever the fuck I want.

509
00:41:38.503 --> 00:41:40.271
Did you not just hear
what I said?

510
00:41:40.304 --> 00:41:42.539
There is no way Batman's cool
with beatin' up cops.

511
00:41:42.572 --> 00:41:45.277
He isn't.
But I don't see him here.

512
00:41:45.309 --> 00:41:49.047
The cops in Gotham kicked my ass
every night. Now I get to kick back.

513
00:41:49.079 --> 00:41:51.983
You obviously have
your own shit goin' on.

514
00:41:52.016 --> 00:41:54.227
But you're gonna wake up one day
and have no idea who you are.

515
00:41:54.251 --> 00:41:57.289
Coming from the guy screaming "I'm
not Robin, I don't wanna be Robin"

516
00:41:57.322 --> 00:42:01.592
standing there in a fucking Robin suit,
carrying that case all over the country!

517
00:42:01.626 --> 00:42:03.728
You wanna know the real
difference between us?

518
00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.030
I know who I am, man.

519
00:42:05.063 --> 00:42:09.634
I kick ass with Batman
and I fucking love it.

520
00:42:09.666 --> 00:42:13.416
But who the fuck are you?

521
00:42:15.773 --> 00:42:19.373
Fuck you!

522
00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:52.876
You could've told me
about being Robin.

523
00:42:56.179 --> 00:42:58.382
I'm tryin' to give it up.

524
00:42:58.416 --> 00:43:00.650
Does Bruce know?

525
00:43:00.684 --> 00:43:04.454
Know what?

526
00:43:04.487 --> 00:43:08.387
That you work with Batman?

527
00:43:11.128 --> 00:43:14.277
I don't. Not anymore.

528
00:43:19.336 --> 00:43:24.208
Bruce did right by you.

529
00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:28.545
Didn't he?

530
00:43:28.579 --> 00:43:32.329
He did the best he could.

531
00:43:48.264 --> 00:43:49.166
Hey.

532
00:43:49.201 --> 00:43:52.670
- Hey, is Adamson awake?
- Not yet.

533
00:43:52.704 --> 00:43:56.673
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I am.

534
00:43:56.708 --> 00:43:59.744
- I'm on my way back.
- About time.

535
00:43:59.777 --> 00:44:04.577
How many Robins should I expect?

536
00:44:06.983 --> 00:44:07.983
None.

537
00:44:31.409 --> 00:44:34.545
Welcome back.

538
00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.784
It's time to talk.

539
00:44:40.818 --> 00:44:43.286
Where's Rachel?

540
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.556
Doesn't matter.

541
00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:51.561
You're not getting
anywhere near her.

542
00:44:51.596 --> 00:44:55.800
You can do anything
you like to me.

543
00:44:55.833 --> 00:44:59.570
You can kill me if you want.

544
00:44:59.603 --> 00:45:04.603
I'm not talking to anyone
but Rachel.
