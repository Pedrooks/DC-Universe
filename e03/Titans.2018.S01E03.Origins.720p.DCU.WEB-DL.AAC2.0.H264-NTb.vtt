<i>Previously on</i> Titans...

2
00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:26.958
<i>Someone killed my mom!</i>

3
00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:30.495
<i>I'm Detective Dick Grayson.</i>

4
00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:31.674
<i>You wanna talk
about what happened?</i>

5
00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:32.932
You need to lock me up.

6
00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:34.634
There is something
inside of me.

7
00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.268
<i>Something evil.</i>

8
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.506
<i>I woke up in a car.
And these men tried to kill me...</i>

9
00:00:43.341 --> 00:00:44.476
Who are you, exactly?

10
00:00:44.543 --> 00:00:45.878
Who the hell are you?

11
00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:50.417
I don't...
I don't know.

12
00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:52.518
<i>Who is she?
What do you want with her?</i>

13
00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:53.853
<i>I don't know.</i>

14
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.097
We need
somewhere safe to regroup.

15
00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:57.289
Hey.

16
00:00:57.356 --> 00:00:58.924
You're activated.

17
00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:01.293
- Family trip.
- Who's first?

18
00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.530
Me.

19
00:01:04.596 --> 00:01:06.031
Who the fuck
are these guys?

20
00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:13.239
Hank!

21
00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:16.310
No!

22
00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:18.144
Talk to me.

23
00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:20.612
You're gonna be okay.

24
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.680
There you are, dear.

25
00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:32.191
Hank!

26
00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:36.262
No!

27
00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:46.204
Well...

28
00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:49.272
There you are, dear.

29
00:04:04.076 --> 00:04:05.316
Who the hell are you?

30
00:04:05.343 --> 00:04:08.347
Kory Anders. FBI.

31
00:04:08.413 --> 00:04:11.082
FBI? In that outfit?

32
00:04:12.384 --> 00:04:13.719
Stop right there.

33
00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:16.254
My ID's in my pocket.
Can I reach for it?

34
00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:17.990
Or would you like to?

35
00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:21.057
Take it out. Slowly.

36
00:04:36.274 --> 00:04:38.375
What the shit?

37
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.622
Shit!

38
00:04:53.225 --> 00:04:58.225
No, wait...

39
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.416
I spy a cow.

40
00:05:18.483 --> 00:05:19.651
Bingo.

41
00:05:19.718 --> 00:05:21.053
- What? That's not fair.
- Is too.

42
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.288
I saw it first.
I win again.

43
00:05:23.355 --> 00:05:24.458
Dad!

44
00:05:24.524 --> 00:05:27.293
Come on now.
No one likes a poor winner.

45
00:05:27.358 --> 00:05:28.494
What is this freak show?

46
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.430
Manners, dear.

47
00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:34.600
Now, who needs to go
before we hit the highway?

48
00:05:34.666 --> 00:05:36.235
Hmm?

49
00:05:43.642 --> 00:05:45.077
Anyone thirsty?

50
00:05:45.144 --> 00:05:47.379
Can I get a soda?

51
00:05:47.446 --> 00:05:50.745
Sugar makes him hyper.

52
00:05:57.324 --> 00:06:02.324
Hurry up, Rachel.
We haven't got all day.

53
00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:05.396
Rachel?

54
00:06:05.463 --> 00:06:06.464
Rachel.

55
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:08.033
I'm coming.

56
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.468
Come on now, Rachel.
There're people waiting on you.

57
00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:14.240
Uh, I'll be right out.

58
00:06:14.307 --> 00:06:16.175
Rachel?

59
00:06:16.242 --> 00:06:21.242
<i>Who's gonna
help you now, bitch?</i>

60
00:06:33.257 --> 00:06:34.608
Oh, gosh.

61
00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:41.666
Who are you?

62
00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.853
Do you know who I am?

63
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.290
Girl, who am I?

64
00:07:05.357 --> 00:07:07.793
I don't know.

65
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.495
Come on.

66
00:07:09.562 --> 00:07:14.562
I have a feeling you'll do
better with me than with them.

67
00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:24.925
Oh, dear.

68
00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:37.549
So?

69
00:08:37.615 --> 00:08:39.351
How you feeling?

70
00:08:39.418 --> 00:08:42.922
I got it. Got it.
Stupid question. I know.

71
00:08:47.025 --> 00:08:48.794
I've got some great news.

72
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:52.899
Someone has volunteered
to be your foster parent.

73
00:08:52.966 --> 00:08:57.302
Bruce Wayne was at the circus
the night your parents died.

74
00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.471
He saw what happened.

75
00:09:01.706 --> 00:09:05.756
I want to help you.

76
00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:14.582
I assume you know
who Mr. Wayne is, right?

77
00:09:16.023 --> 00:09:19.725
And, Dick, there's something
else we need to talk about.

78
00:09:19.793 --> 00:09:24.596
The police have been
discussing the incident.

79
00:09:24.663 --> 00:09:26.466
They believe

80
00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:29.500
it may not have
been an accident.

81
00:09:29.567 --> 00:09:32.004
What?

82
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:33.273
Someone killed my parents?

83
00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:36.708
They suspect.
They're not sure.

84
00:09:36.775 --> 00:09:38.275
I'm sorry.

85
00:10:49.883 --> 00:10:53.519
Master Wayne,
do you really think this is a good idea?

86
00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:56.256
The boy's been
through so much.

87
00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:59.558
I don't need to remind you that
your extracurricular activities

88
00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:02.195
are not conducive
to taking care of a child.

89
00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:04.163
I understand, Alfred.

90
00:12:06.994 --> 00:12:11.197
- Hank, I'm sorry. If I hadn't...
- Who were they?

91
00:12:11.264 --> 00:12:13.798
What the hell
do they want with Rachel?

92
00:12:13.865 --> 00:12:15.816
I don't know.

93
00:12:21.573 --> 00:12:25.811
You take care of her.

94
00:12:25.878 --> 00:12:28.427
I will find them.

95
00:12:46.597 --> 00:12:47.399
Grayson.

96
00:12:47.466 --> 00:12:49.302
Don't sound so excited.

97
00:12:49.369 --> 00:12:51.104
<i>Sorry.
Caught me at a bad time.</i>

98
00:12:51.171 --> 00:12:53.448
I thought you'd be on a beach
sipping on a pina colada by now.

99
00:12:53.472 --> 00:12:54.941
Yeah, something like that.
What's up?

100
00:12:55.008 --> 00:12:57.777
<i>Forensics came back on
the Roth murder weapon.</i>

101
00:12:57.844 --> 00:13:01.114
There are prints, but they don't
belong to your girl Rachel Roth.

102
00:13:01.181 --> 00:13:05.985
Traverse City P.D. called for
you this morning about her.

103
00:13:06.052 --> 00:13:07.352
About Rachel?

104
00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:09.855
They had an intruder
at the Roth crime scene.

105
00:13:09.923 --> 00:13:12.957
African-American female.
Maybe six foot.

106
00:13:13.024 --> 00:13:14.494
<i>Magenta hair.</i>

107
00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:17.196
<i>Apparently she assaulted
several officers.</i>

108
00:13:17.263 --> 00:13:19.365
BOLO came back
with a match on her

109
00:13:19.432 --> 00:13:22.668
at a gas station
up your way off the 495.

110
00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:25.672
<i>Security cameras caught
her leaving with a girl</i>

111
00:13:25.739 --> 00:13:28.408
<i>matching the description
of Rachel Roth.</i>

112
00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:31.009
<i>And she left behind a body.</i>

113
00:13:31.076 --> 00:13:32.077
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

114
00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:34.379
And Grayson, one more thing.

115
00:13:34.447 --> 00:13:39.351
About Rohrbach, she's dead.

116
00:13:39.418 --> 00:13:44.157
<i>Murdered.</i>

117
00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:01.607
That's not mine.

118
00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:06.044
We've never met? Ever?

119
00:14:06.111 --> 00:14:07.647
Fuck.

120
00:14:07.714 --> 00:14:09.057
You know it's
a weird question, right?

121
00:14:09.081 --> 00:14:14.081
Just sit there and be quiet.
I need to think.

122
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.195
Do not do that!

123
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.263
What did you just do anyway?

124
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.500
I can feel what
other people are feeling.

125
00:14:28.567 --> 00:14:32.371
But I couldn't feel
anything from you.

126
00:14:32.437 --> 00:14:35.041
Who are you?

127
00:14:35.106 --> 00:14:36.174
What do you want from me?

128
00:14:36.241 --> 00:14:38.077
I don't know.

129
00:14:38.144 --> 00:14:41.779
Just know that there are people out
there trying to hurt you and I'm not.

130
00:14:41.846 --> 00:14:44.918
Okay?

131
00:14:44.985 --> 00:14:49.455
Who were they? Those people,
what do they want from you?

132
00:14:49.522 --> 00:14:53.091
I don't know.

133
00:14:53.158 --> 00:14:56.195
Could I at least know your name?

134
00:14:56.261 --> 00:14:59.631
You can call me Kory.

135
00:14:59.698 --> 00:15:03.269
If that's even really it.

136
00:15:03.336 --> 00:15:04.803
You don't know your own name?

137
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.907
I don't remember anything
past a few days ago,

138
00:15:06.972 --> 00:15:08.575
except that I've been
looking for you.

139
00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.245
- Why?
- I don't know.

140
00:15:11.311 --> 00:15:16.311
I was hoping if I met you,
it would trigger something but, I...

141
00:15:16.515 --> 00:15:21.515
You don't seem to know
who I am either.

142
00:15:30.028 --> 00:15:32.698
Mom.

143
00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:37.765
- Where'd you get this?
- Your house.

144
00:15:40.172 --> 00:15:42.508
What's St. Paul's?

145
00:15:42.575 --> 00:15:47.524
We're gonna find out
soon enough.

146
00:15:49.347 --> 00:15:51.350
How did you
do that back there?

147
00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:53.152
Do what?

148
00:15:53.219 --> 00:15:56.056
That man... You burned him?

149
00:15:56.123 --> 00:15:59.591
I don't know.
There's something inside of me.

150
00:15:59.658 --> 00:16:02.394
- A power.
- I don't really understand it.

151
00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:07.461
- Me, too. It's a darkness.
- A light.

152
00:16:20.044 --> 00:16:25.017
Be with you in a sec.

153
00:16:25.083 --> 00:16:26.118
What are you doing?

154
00:16:26.184 --> 00:16:28.354
Making sure it's safe.

155
00:16:28.421 --> 00:16:32.424
Paranoid much?

156
00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:34.594
Can I, uh,
get you two anything?

157
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.730
Chicken and waffles.

158
00:16:36.796 --> 00:16:39.798
Chicken and waffles coming up.
Best in the county.

159
00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:41.567
Miss, can I get you
something, too?

160
00:16:41.634 --> 00:16:43.336
No, thank you.

161
00:16:43.403 --> 00:16:46.038
- Three beers.
- We don't serve until after 12:00.

162
00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:47.506
Fuck you, Daryl.

163
00:16:47.573 --> 00:16:49.509
Travis, leave it.

164
00:16:49.576 --> 00:16:51.344
- Travis, let me go.
- No.

165
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:52.445
I told you this is over.

166
00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:54.114
- No, it's not.
- Yes.

167
00:16:54.181 --> 00:16:55.621
You need
to answer my calls.

168
00:16:55.648 --> 00:16:57.549
- You do what I tell you to do.
- Let go.

169
00:16:57.616 --> 00:16:59.086
Excuse me, Travis.

170
00:16:59.152 --> 00:17:04.152
She was taking our order
and we're in a bit of a hurry.

171
00:17:05.324 --> 00:17:10.029
Go get us our drinks.

172
00:17:10.096 --> 00:17:14.267
You should go find
someplace else to eat.

173
00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:16.036
Go wait in the car, Rachel.

174
00:17:16.103 --> 00:17:18.671
That's right.
You go with her, too, sweet cheeks.

175
00:17:18.738 --> 00:17:20.105
Before someone gets hurt.

176
00:17:20.172 --> 00:17:21.907
Go.

177
00:17:21.974 --> 00:17:24.974
- But what if...
- Now.

178
00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:37.923
How about you get
the fuck outta here?

179
00:18:23.135 --> 00:18:27.773
Chicken and waffles.
On the house, apparently.

180
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.142
Well, I know
one thing about you.

181
00:18:30.209 --> 00:18:32.159
Total badass.

182
00:18:56.369 --> 00:19:00.239
<i>You know the first rule
about running away?</i>

183
00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:04.108
It's never about running away.

184
00:19:04.175 --> 00:19:07.346
It's about power,

185
00:19:07.413 --> 00:19:11.585
at a time in your life
when you feel totally powerless.

186
00:19:11.652 --> 00:19:14.386
I know you don't think that you can
handle what you're going through,

187
00:19:14.452 --> 00:19:16.021
but you can.

188
00:19:16.088 --> 00:19:19.959
If you just let
other people help you.

189
00:19:20.026 --> 00:19:23.461
Mr. Wayne understands
what you're feeling.

190
00:19:23.528 --> 00:19:26.298
He wants to give you a home.

191
00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:30.269
That is a gift, Dick.

192
00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:32.505
Give it another try.

193
00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:34.773
Please.

194
00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:38.590
He lost his parents, too.

195
00:24:56.363 --> 00:24:58.897
Hello, there.
Can I help you...

196
00:24:58.964 --> 00:25:02.234
You're back.

197
00:25:02.301 --> 00:25:06.705
My Lord, it can't be.

198
00:25:06.771 --> 00:25:07.839
Is this her?

199
00:25:07.906 --> 00:25:11.978
Oh! Look how big
you've grown.

200
00:25:12.045 --> 00:25:15.446
It's been such
a long time, my child.

201
00:25:15.513 --> 00:25:20.153
Oh.

202
00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:23.288
You don't remember anything?

203
00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:26.058
Not a thing.
Only that I was looking for...

204
00:25:26.125 --> 00:25:27.894
- Her.
- Mmm-hmm.

205
00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.663
Did I say why?

206
00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:32.832
You came here a year ago and said
only that she was in danger,

207
00:25:32.898 --> 00:25:34.633
that they'd found her.

208
00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.269
Who had found her?

209
00:25:36.336 --> 00:25:38.738
You only said you just had to find her.
And you did.

210
00:25:38.804 --> 00:25:40.339
And you brought her back to us,

211
00:25:40.406 --> 00:25:43.843
right as rain
and beautiful as ever.

212
00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:45.278
You came to us just a baby.

213
00:25:45.345 --> 00:25:46.913
You and your mother, Melissa.

214
00:25:46.979 --> 00:25:48.280
You stayed with us for a while.

215
00:25:48.347 --> 00:25:50.148
- You knew my mother?
- Yes.

216
00:25:50.215 --> 00:25:53.818
How is she?

217
00:25:53.885 --> 00:25:57.155
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

218
00:25:57.222 --> 00:25:58.625
What were they doing here?

219
00:25:58.692 --> 00:26:00.159
Your mother
was worried about you.

220
00:26:00.226 --> 00:26:02.261
She was trying to protect you.

221
00:26:02.327 --> 00:26:04.496
Protect me from what?

222
00:26:04.563 --> 00:26:08.769
I cannot say.

223
00:26:08.835 --> 00:26:13.835
You don't remember anything
about being here, child?

224
00:26:15.641 --> 00:26:17.376
That, maybe?

225
00:26:17.443 --> 00:26:20.011
Oh.
Mary meeting the divine.

226
00:26:20.078 --> 00:26:22.147
A favorite of mine.

227
00:26:22.214 --> 00:26:24.151
What does Mary see?

228
00:26:24.218 --> 00:26:29.218
Can forces we consider purely
theological take corporeal form?

229
00:26:29.923 --> 00:26:34.923
Do you see a figure in the
ether trying to emerge?

230
00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:37.428
A man?

231
00:26:45.604 --> 00:26:48.773
Not sure.

232
00:26:53.814 --> 00:26:56.849
Your old bedroom
is at the end of the hall, dear.

233
00:26:56.916 --> 00:27:00.752
What were you saying?
Who was chasing Rachel and her mother?

234
00:27:00.819 --> 00:27:02.221
When she was brought to us,

235
00:27:02.288 --> 00:27:04.789
apparently Rachel was
hiding from her father.

236
00:27:04.856 --> 00:27:06.459
I don't know the details.

237
00:27:06.526 --> 00:27:08.394
All I know is that
her mother was frightened

238
00:27:08.461 --> 00:27:12.566
and convinced that she and
the baby were in danger.

239
00:27:12.632 --> 00:27:14.835
The young woman's fear
was quite convincing.

240
00:27:14.902 --> 00:27:18.739
As were the fresh strangle
marks around her neck.

241
00:27:18.805 --> 00:27:20.165
Her father,
do you know who he was?

242
00:27:20.205 --> 00:27:21.840
Did he ever come
looking for her?

243
00:27:21.907 --> 00:27:23.407
I'm sorry.

244
00:27:27.413 --> 00:27:28.915
Oh.

245
00:27:28.981 --> 00:27:32.285
Truth be told, we haven't had
much call for this room of late.

246
00:27:32.352 --> 00:27:37.352
It's a bit neglected,
I'm sorry to say.

247
00:27:41.294 --> 00:27:45.631
Welcome home, Rachel.

248
00:27:52.672 --> 00:27:55.173
What now?

249
00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.509
Thought I'd find
the answers here.

250
00:27:57.576 --> 00:28:01.314
Oh, don't give up so quickly.

251
00:28:01.381 --> 00:28:04.683
I know I feel danger.

252
00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:09.221
And I can't let her
out of my sight.

253
00:28:09.288 --> 00:28:12.588
I just don't know why.

254
00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:18.798
Hey, this doesn't mean
anything to you, does it?

255
00:28:18.865 --> 00:28:21.534
Oh, of course. It's from
Scooter's Roller Palace

256
00:28:21.601 --> 00:28:25.137
just down the road.
It's a lively place.

257
00:28:25.203 --> 00:28:28.141
The young people quite like it.

258
00:28:28.207 --> 00:28:30.175
Hmm.

259
00:28:30.242 --> 00:28:32.811
The Lord works
in mysterious ways.

260
00:28:32.877 --> 00:28:35.213
Huh.

261
00:28:55.701 --> 00:28:58.938
Butterscotch?

262
00:28:59.005 --> 00:29:00.205
Manners.

263
00:29:00.272 --> 00:29:01.406
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

264
00:29:23.529 --> 00:29:26.231
Well, hello, family.

265
00:29:26.298 --> 00:29:27.500
Doctor Adamson.

266
00:29:27.567 --> 00:29:30.269
I'm making omelets.

267
00:29:30.336 --> 00:29:33.638
It seems
I may have over-shopped.

268
00:29:33.705 --> 00:29:36.842
One less?

269
00:29:36.909 --> 00:29:39.111
We failed.

270
00:29:39.178 --> 00:29:43.348
Clearly.

271
00:29:43.415 --> 00:29:47.386
This being who took her
from you is unique.

272
00:29:47.452 --> 00:29:51.089
We have only recently
become aware of her.

273
00:29:51.156 --> 00:29:54.326
Granted she is formidable,

274
00:29:54.394 --> 00:29:57.544
but she is no Rachel.

275
00:30:01.134 --> 00:30:05.634
We built you
better than this.

276
00:30:11.076 --> 00:30:13.880
Any last words?

277
00:30:13.946 --> 00:30:16.449
What's so important
about this Roth girl, anyway?

278
00:30:16.516 --> 00:30:18.017
Honey, seen, not heard.

279
00:30:18.084 --> 00:30:21.354
No. I appreciate
a bit of spirit.

280
00:30:21.421 --> 00:30:24.890
This "girl" as you call her

281
00:30:24.957 --> 00:30:28.361
is far more than that.

282
00:30:28.428 --> 00:30:31.096
Look around you.

283
00:30:31.163 --> 00:30:34.866
Oppression. Indignity.

284
00:30:34.933 --> 00:30:37.002
Perversion.

285
00:30:37.068 --> 00:30:39.172
Pain.

286
00:30:39.238 --> 00:30:44.238
All hidden behind
smiles of dishonor.

287
00:30:44.644 --> 00:30:48.847
Her father will reveal us.

288
00:30:48.913 --> 00:30:50.616
When he comes,

289
00:30:50.683 --> 00:30:54.520
he will scrub the flesh
of this world clean

290
00:30:54.586 --> 00:30:59.086
and show us
who we really are.

291
00:31:00.192 --> 00:31:02.494
But he can't arrive

292
00:31:02.561 --> 00:31:05.597
without an invitation.

293
00:31:05.664 --> 00:31:10.664
He can't come here
without her welcome.

294
00:31:13.138 --> 00:31:17.410
But when he does...

295
00:31:17.477 --> 00:31:21.513
what dreams may come.

296
00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:26.580
I'd like to see
a world like that.

297
00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:34.391
Would you now?

298
00:31:38.498 --> 00:31:40.633
Well, I've already
cracked the eggs.

299
00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:43.769
Be a shame for them to go to waste.

300
00:31:43.836 --> 00:31:46.439
Would you like
another chance

301
00:31:46.506 --> 00:31:48.708
to bring her to me?

302
00:31:48.775 --> 00:31:52.310
To save your last words
for another day?

303
00:31:52.377 --> 00:31:54.248
Yes, please.

304
00:31:54.314 --> 00:31:59.314
Research suggests two-parent families
have a better chance at success.

305
00:31:59.484 --> 00:32:03.589
How about we get you
another dad?

306
00:32:03.655 --> 00:32:08.306
Oh, I wouldn't
eat the candies.

307
00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:11.530
Now, who likes cheese?

308
00:32:45.298 --> 00:32:46.798
Seriously?

309
00:32:56.541 --> 00:32:58.376
You should try some.

310
00:32:58.443 --> 00:33:01.279
Pass. You gonna be
long with that?

311
00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:05.284
I ordered a burger, too.

312
00:33:14.728 --> 00:33:16.962
That cop you told me
about in Detroit.

313
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:19.499
Yeah. Dick.
What about him?

314
00:33:19.566 --> 00:33:20.933
He's not your father, is he?

315
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000
No, no. He was just a
cop who was trying...

316
00:33:27.539 --> 00:33:29.608
It doesn't matter.

317
00:33:29.675 --> 00:33:34.248
He didn't really wanna
help me anyway.

318
00:33:34.314 --> 00:33:36.481
So, you know anything
about your real father?

319
00:33:36.548 --> 00:33:37.584
Not much.

320
00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:41.255
My mom, Melissa,

321
00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:46.025
she never talked about him.
I mean, like, not ever.

322
00:33:50.931 --> 00:33:53.165
I'm gonna change this music
before my head explodes.

323
00:33:53.232 --> 00:33:57.202
Well, I need change
for the arcade.

324
00:33:57.269 --> 00:34:00.269
- Really?
- All I got.

325
00:34:04.376 --> 00:34:06.178
<i>Jumbo!</i>

326
00:34:06.244 --> 00:34:09.094
<i>Power bomb.</i>

327
00:34:11.416 --> 00:34:14.266
<i>Extra bomb!</i>

328
00:34:16.623 --> 00:34:18.324
<i>- Hitchhiker.
- Hitchhiker Lane.</i>

329
00:34:18.391 --> 00:34:20.860
Nice.

330
00:34:20.927 --> 00:34:23.596
Um... uh, go for
the Camera Sinkhole.

331
00:34:23.663 --> 00:34:28.501
<i>Score. Multiplier.</i>

332
00:34:28.568 --> 00:34:30.001
- I'm, uh, Gar.
- I'm Rachel.

333
00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:31.972
<i>Good call.</i>

334
00:34:32.038 --> 00:34:35.440
- I like your hair.
- Your hair is cool.

335
00:34:35.507 --> 00:34:37.275
Look out!

336
00:34:37.342 --> 00:34:38.543
<i>Jackpot!</i>

337
00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:43.610
- Multiball!
- Multiball!

338
00:34:56.528 --> 00:34:59.898
Excuse me.

339
00:34:59.965 --> 00:35:02.134
Hey.

340
00:35:02.201 --> 00:35:03.235
I gotta talk to you.

341
00:35:03.302 --> 00:35:06.302
Yeah, take a number.

342
00:35:09.342 --> 00:35:11.291
About Rachel.

343
00:35:14.947 --> 00:35:18.416
You're Dick from Detroit.

344
00:35:18.483 --> 00:35:20.286
Where is she?

345
00:35:20.353 --> 00:35:22.688
- Hey, come on. We're going.
- What are you doing here?

346
00:35:22.755 --> 00:35:23.755
Now's not the time, okay?

347
00:35:23.822 --> 00:35:25.192
Why are you here?

348
00:35:25.257 --> 00:35:30.257
Can we talk about this
somewhere else? Let's go.

349
00:35:35.969 --> 00:35:37.680
Rachel, we gotta
get you somewhere safe.

350
00:35:37.704 --> 00:35:40.271
Do you know who sent
that weird family after her?

351
00:35:40.338 --> 00:35:42.175
Who the hell are you?

352
00:35:42.242 --> 00:35:44.844
I don't know. But somehow Rachel's
the key to me figuring me out.

353
00:35:44.911 --> 00:35:46.146
Is that why you kidnapped her?

354
00:35:46.213 --> 00:35:51.213
She didn't kidnap me.
She saved me.

355
00:35:55.054 --> 00:35:56.789
- How's Dawn?
- Rachel...

356
00:35:56.856 --> 00:35:59.559
I read what happened online.
Is she gonna be okay?

357
00:35:59.625 --> 00:36:02.329
Who's Dawn?

358
00:36:02.396 --> 00:36:04.831
I really can't talk about
this right now, okay?

359
00:36:04.898 --> 00:36:07.500
The cops are looking for you.

360
00:36:07.567 --> 00:36:08.807
They think you killed your mom.

361
00:36:08.867 --> 00:36:10.503
That's news.

362
00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:11.971
I may have failed to mention...

363
00:36:12.038 --> 00:36:14.106
And they're
looking for you, too.

364
00:36:14.173 --> 00:36:16.541
Assault on multiple officers.
Arson.

365
00:36:16.608 --> 00:36:18.177
And not to mention kidnapping.

366
00:36:18.244 --> 00:36:21.313
Like I said,
she didn't kidnap me, she saved me.

367
00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:22.614
When you didn't.

368
00:36:22.681 --> 00:36:26.719
Well, that's
technically true. Dick.

369
00:36:26.786 --> 00:36:28.887
Gee, that's a new one.

370
00:36:28.954 --> 00:36:31.858
I'm not going without her.

371
00:36:31.925 --> 00:36:35.293
Mmm. What she said.

372
00:36:36.963 --> 00:36:38.506
Can you please tell me
what the hell is going on?

373
00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:40.300
- You left me.
- No, I didn't.

374
00:36:40.367 --> 00:36:42.202
You might as well have.
You were going to.

375
00:36:42.268 --> 00:36:44.036
- Rachel, I wasn't.
- I read the note.

376
00:36:44.103 --> 00:36:45.715
- Look...
- You were just gonna leave me with them?

377
00:36:45.739 --> 00:36:47.149
- I just need time to figure things out.
- Stop.

378
00:36:47.173 --> 00:36:50.677
- Rachel.
- Stop lying!

379
00:36:52.144 --> 00:36:55.313
I need to go back
to the Sisters!

380
00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:58.717
Okay.

381
00:36:58.784 --> 00:37:02.822
Okay. Come on, let's go.

382
00:37:13.333 --> 00:37:15.635
Stealing private property.

383
00:37:15.702 --> 00:37:19.605
Operating a vehicle underage.

384
00:37:19.672 --> 00:37:22.742
Are you listening?

385
00:37:22.809 --> 00:37:25.978
We're talking about a class-A
misdemeanor at best.

386
00:37:26.045 --> 00:37:28.947
You could spend time in juvie.

387
00:37:29.014 --> 00:37:31.652
People could've
gotten hurt, Dick.

388
00:37:31.719 --> 00:37:35.588
If it was anyone else they'd
press charges, but you've lucked out.

389
00:37:35.655 --> 00:37:39.760
Mr. Wayne isn't interested
in sending you to jail.

390
00:37:39.827 --> 00:37:42.762
Listen... You can't keep
running away like that.

391
00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:44.697
I'm not running away.

392
00:37:44.764 --> 00:37:46.532
- I'm searching.
- For what?

393
00:37:46.599 --> 00:37:47.967
Answers.

394
00:37:48.034 --> 00:37:49.845
- Answers for what?
- To who killed my parents.

395
00:37:49.869 --> 00:37:51.981
- The police are doing their best...
- No, not the police!

396
00:37:52.005 --> 00:37:53.505
I have to be the one
who finds them!

397
00:37:53.572 --> 00:37:57.472
- Why?
- So I can kill them.

398
00:39:03.675 --> 00:39:06.945
Rachel.

399
00:39:07.012 --> 00:39:09.748
I don't know what to do.

400
00:39:09.815 --> 00:39:11.684
What set you off?
Were you scared?

401
00:39:11.751 --> 00:39:13.485
Was I scared?

402
00:39:13.552 --> 00:39:16.289
I'm always scared.

403
00:39:16.356 --> 00:39:18.157
- Listen, I need you to...
- What?

404
00:39:18.222 --> 00:39:20.193
Trust you?

405
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:24.463
Other people can help,
is that it?

406
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:27.000
No, they can't.

407
00:39:27.065 --> 00:39:29.702
They'll just make promises...

408
00:39:29.768 --> 00:39:33.806
but in the end they'll fail.

409
00:39:33.873 --> 00:39:37.742
They'll all leave.

410
00:39:37.809 --> 00:39:39.909
Just like you.

411
00:39:46.186 --> 00:39:48.253
Yeah. You're right.

412
00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.320
What?

413
00:39:55.161 --> 00:39:57.864
You're on your own.

414
00:39:57.931 --> 00:40:02.731
No one can help you.
Not really.

415
00:40:03.202 --> 00:40:06.206
I was just like you once.

416
00:40:06.273 --> 00:40:09.675
I thought if
I leaned on someone,

417
00:40:09.742 --> 00:40:11.610
if I trusted them,

418
00:40:11.677 --> 00:40:15.726
all the pain would go away.

419
00:40:17.016 --> 00:40:20.920
I was wrong.

420
00:40:20.987 --> 00:40:25.987
And anyone that tells you
any differently is lying.

421
00:40:26.326 --> 00:40:28.961
The loss is here
for good now.

422
00:40:29.027 --> 00:40:33.333
There's no getting over it.

423
00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:37.103
But you can control it.
You can channel it.

424
00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:40.472
No one else can do that for you.

425
00:40:40.539 --> 00:40:41.889
Just you.

426
00:40:52.485 --> 00:40:57.485
I think I need
to stay here a while, okay?

427
00:40:57.722 --> 00:40:59.373
Yeah. Sure.

428
00:41:16.376 --> 00:41:19.077
Oh, she needs
a minute by herself.

429
00:41:19.144 --> 00:41:21.681
God is with her.

430
00:41:21.746 --> 00:41:24.784
- Right.
- Hmm.

431
00:41:24.851 --> 00:41:28.253
When she was a girl, did she
ever show signs of any, um...

432
00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:32.757
- Any, um...
- Any what?

433
00:41:32.824 --> 00:41:35.128
Nothing.

434
00:42:09.695 --> 00:42:11.697
There you go.

435
00:42:11.764 --> 00:42:14.432
- Is it okay?
- Hmm?

436
00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:15.735
To drink in here?

437
00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:20.300
Oh, I won't tell
if you won't.

438
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.275
Feeling better?

439
00:42:23.342 --> 00:42:26.079
Your friend said
you need some time.

440
00:42:26.144 --> 00:42:29.744
Yeah. Thank you, Sister.

441
00:42:32.351 --> 00:42:36.922
You slept with her
every night.

442
00:42:41.027 --> 00:42:43.896
Oh, this is just
so unexpected.

443
00:42:43.963 --> 00:42:48.400
Seeing you back here.

444
00:42:48.467 --> 00:42:53.467
Truth is we should never have
let you go in the first place.

445
00:42:53.773 --> 00:42:56.608
But you're safe here.

446
00:42:56.675 --> 00:43:01.447
And you always were.

447
00:43:01.512 --> 00:43:04.416
Aw.

448
00:43:04.483 --> 00:43:09.483
I'm so glad
that you've come home.

449
00:43:14.025 --> 00:43:16.762
That's a good girl.

450
00:43:16.829 --> 00:43:21.367
You just sleep.

451

Rachel.

463
00:45:10.208 --> 00:45:11.744
What happened?

464
00:45:11.811 --> 00:45:14.648
I gave you something
to relax you.

465
00:45:14.713 --> 00:45:19.713
You'll feel a little lightheaded.
It's normal.

466
00:45:25.358 --> 00:45:28.208
We're almost there.

467
00:45:51.217 --> 00:45:53.985
Easy, child.

468
00:45:54.052 --> 00:45:55.721
Easy.

469
00:45:55.788 --> 00:45:56.889
Where am I?

470
00:45:56.956 --> 00:45:59.891
I promised you'd be
safe here, didn't I?

471
00:45:59.958 --> 00:46:02.394
And here you are. Safe.

472
00:46:02.461 --> 00:46:06.199
- What happened?
- Just...

473
00:46:06.266 --> 00:46:09.469
We thought if we could get you
far enough away from him...

474
00:46:09.536 --> 00:46:13.072
You were just
a baby after all.

475
00:46:13.139 --> 00:46:14.840
We were weak.

476
00:46:14.907 --> 00:46:16.643
It may not make sense now,

477
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:18.545
but you'll
eventually understand.

478
00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:22.248
And I promise, it's for the best.
He won't find you here.

479
00:46:22.315 --> 00:46:26.085
I wish there were another way.

480
00:46:26.152 --> 00:46:29.255
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

481
00:46:29.322 --> 00:46:31.456
What are you...

482
00:46:31.523 --> 00:46:35.860
What are you doing?

483
00:46:35.927 --> 00:46:39.766
Sister?

484
00:46:39.833 --> 00:46:43.168
We all must make
sacrifices, child.

485
00:46:43.235 --> 00:46:44.585
Let's go.

486
00:47:06.358 --> 00:47:07.661
No!

487
00:47:07.726 --> 00:47:11.177
No!

488
00:47:24.976 --> 00:47:27.045
Hey!

489
00:47:27.112 --> 00:47:30.851
You stole my car. I like my car.

490
00:47:30.916 --> 00:47:32.418
How did you find me?

491
00:47:32.485 --> 00:47:36.188
There's an app for that.

492
00:47:36.255 --> 00:47:40.605
- This place yours?
- Think so.

493
00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:44.963
How long you been
looking for Rachel?

494
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:49.335
A few months, I thought.

495
00:47:49.402 --> 00:47:52.371
Seems like a lot longer
than a few months.

496
00:47:52.438 --> 00:47:53.938
You think?

497
00:48:16.027 --> 00:48:18.898
This yours, too?

498
00:48:18.963 --> 00:48:19.965
What's that writing?

499
00:48:22.201 --> 00:48:23.302
What does that mean?

500
00:48:23.369 --> 00:48:27.740
I have no idea.

501
00:48:27.806 --> 00:48:30.009
Where did you say
you were from again?

502
00:48:30.076 --> 00:48:31.425
I didn't.

503
00:48:41.788 --> 00:48:44.690
Somebody,
let me out please!

504
00:48:44.757 --> 00:48:46.291
No!

505
00:48:48.561 --> 00:48:50.929
<i>Rachel.</i>

506
00:48:50.996 --> 00:48:53.695
No.

507
00:48:56.335 --> 00:48:59.505
<i>Look at me.</i>

508
00:48:59.572 --> 00:49:02.871
<i>That's better.</i>

509
00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:07.313
Somebody,
let me out, please!

510
00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:11.617
<i>No one's coming for you.</i>

511
00:49:11.684 --> 00:49:13.085
<i>They locked you up.</i>

512
00:49:13.152 --> 00:49:17.222
<i>They thought
they could protect you.</i>

513
00:49:17.289 --> 00:49:19.592
<i>"She'll be safe here.</i>

514
00:49:19.659 --> 00:49:23.396
<i>He won't find her here."</i>

515
00:49:23.463 --> 00:49:25.831
<i>But they were wrong.</i>

516
00:49:25.898 --> 00:49:28.233
No!

517
00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:33.405
<i>No one wants you, Rachel.</i>

518
00:49:33.472 --> 00:49:35.509
<i>You couldn't
save your mother.</i>

519
00:49:35.576 --> 00:49:38.876
<i>Her brains got blown out right before
your eyes, and you did nothing.</i>

520
00:49:38.943 --> 00:49:39.945
Shut up!

521
00:49:40.012 --> 00:49:44.182
<i>Dawn is dying
because of you.</i>

522
00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:45.251
<i>Who's next?</i>

523
00:49:46.753 --> 00:49:48.987
People around you aren't safe.

524
00:49:49.054 --> 00:49:52.659
<i>Accept it.</i>

525
00:49:56.094 --> 00:49:59.465
<i>Let me in, Rachel.</i>

526
00:49:59.532 --> 00:50:03.402
<i>You are alone.</i>

527
00:50:03.469 --> 00:50:08.469
<i>I'm all you have.</i>

528
00:50:08.974 --> 00:50:11.545
<i>Let me in.</i>

529
00:50:11.612 --> 00:50:15.648
Raven is the first species of birds
to be mentioned in the Torah.

530
00:50:15.715 --> 00:50:17.617
A man came after Rachel.

531
00:50:17.684 --> 00:50:22.684
He had a raven tattoo
on his back.

532
00:50:22.956 --> 00:50:24.556
Rachel's birthday...

533
00:50:24.623 --> 00:50:27.193
The mortality rate spikes
every year on that day.

534
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:28.894
Ever since she was born,

535
00:50:28.961 --> 00:50:33.961
over 200,000
additional dead worldwide.

536
00:50:46.012 --> 00:50:51.012
I think
she's part of a prophecy.

537
00:50:56.355 --> 00:50:58.590
<i>No one will hurt you.</i>

538
00:51:02.061 --> 00:51:03.829
<i>Let me in.</i>

539
00:51:03.896 --> 00:51:06.699
<i>No one will hurt you.</i>

540
00:51:06.766 --> 00:51:10.135
<i>You won't be weak.</i>

541
00:51:10.202 --> 00:51:11.536
<i>You won't be scared...</i>

542
00:51:15.407 --> 00:51:18.344
<i>...ever, ever again.</i>

543
00:51:18.411 --> 00:51:20.545
<i>Look at you.</i>

544
00:51:20.612 --> 00:51:24.650
<i>You're weak, fearful.</i>

545
00:51:24.717 --> 00:51:26.820
<i>Trust me.</i>

546
00:51:26.885 --> 00:51:29.621
<i>Let me in, Rachel.</i>

547
00:51:29.688 --> 00:51:31.456
<i>I can help.</i>

548
00:51:31.523 --> 00:51:32.659
<i>Trust me.</i>

549
00:51:32.724 --> 00:51:34.827
<i>I'm here.</i>

550
00:51:34.893 --> 00:51:39.632
<i>They left you, but I'm here.</i>

551
00:51:39.699 --> 00:51:41.166
<i>Let me in!</i>

552
00:51:47.507 --> 00:51:50.443
She's the Destroyer of Worlds.

553
00:52:14.534 --> 00:52:17.603
Rachel.
